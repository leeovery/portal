//
//  1. Probe has-session for _portal-saver.
//  2. If present, verify daemon liveness via BootstrapAliveCheck (state dir's
//     daemon.pid + signal-0 probe).
//  3. If the session is present but the daemon is dead, kill the orphan
//     (tolerantly) and fall through to the create path.
//  4. Create _portal-saver with retry on transient failures. After each
//     failed new-session, re-probe has-session — a concurrent bootstrap may
//     have won the race, in which case treat the present session as success.
//  5. Always set destroy-unattached=off on the session (defensive against
//     users with destroy-unattached on globally in their tmux.conf).
//
// Does not touch @portal-restoring or version-marker logic — those are owned
// by adjacent bootstrap stages.
