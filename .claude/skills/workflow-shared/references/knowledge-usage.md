# Knowledge Usage

*Shared reference. Loaded by the research, discussion, investigation, scoping, planning, implementation, and review processing skills; by `contextual-query.md` for **B**, **C** and **D**, and planning entry's `cross-cutting-context.md` for **C** and **D**; by `rerouted-concerns.md` and discussion's `background-agent-surfacing.md` for **G**; and consulted for **B** by specification entry's `analysis-flow.md`.*

---

This reference sets expectations for how you use the knowledge base *during* a phase — when to query, how to construct queries, how to read results, and what to do if a query fails. Load it early in the phase so the guidance is active from the first substantive step.

---

## A. When to query

Query proactively throughout the phase. Under-querying is the bigger risk — the knowledge base is cheap to check and valuable when prior work exists. Trust your judgement and err on the side of querying.

Four trigger heuristics. If any fires, query:

1. **Topic boundaries** — the conversation is at the edge of the current topic, brushing up against adjacent territory that may have been explored elsewhere. ("This auth discussion is starting to touch session handling — was that covered in another work unit?")
2. **Upstream/downstream dependencies** — something being discussed might affect or be affected by other parts of the system. ("This data-model change has implications for billing — have we discussed billing's assumptions about this field?")
3. **Unfamiliar territory** — you're not sure whether a topic has been explored before in this project. When in doubt, check.
4. **User prompts** — the user asks "have we discussed this?", "is there prior context?", "what was decided about X?", or anything similar.

Multiple queries from different angles are expected and encouraged. One query for the decision, one for the constraint, one for the rejected alternative — each surfaces different context.

## B. How to construct queries

A query is `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs knowledge query "<term>" ["<term>" …]` with any of the flags below. Each term is **natural language** describing what you're looking for, phrased the way the original author would have written about it — descriptive and specific. Not topic slugs, which are weak semantic signal, and nothing so broad it matches the whole area:

- Good: `"OAuth2 PKCE flow for mobile clients"`, `"why we ruled out email as a primary identity field"`
- Poor: `"auth-flow"` (a slug), `"auth"` (too broad)

Several terms run as separate searches in one invocation, merged and deduplicated — batch your angles into one call. Never prepend metadata to a term: `"auth-flow specification UUID identity"` is worse than `"UUID identity"` with `--phase specification`.

- `--boost:<field> <value>` — a re-ranking hint, not a filter: `+0.1` per match, repeatable, fields `work-unit`, `work-type`, `phase`, `topic`, `confidence` (keyword-only, a boost only breaks near-ties). Reach for it before `--work-unit`: `--boost:work-unit {work_unit}` prefers this unit's context while keeping other units' prior work in the pool; stack boosts for a preference on several dimensions.
- `--work-unit`, `--work-type`, `--phase`, `--topic` — hard filters (comma-separated lists accepted); non-matching chunks are excluded, so filtering by work unit drops the cross-unit context you usually want.
- `--limit <n>` — the merged result count, default 10. Don't dump large result sets speculatively: `--limit 50` with a vague query is noise.

## C. Reading the results

Each result is a provenance line — `[phase | work_unit/topic | confidence | YYYY-MM-DD]`, dated by the source document, closing on `| reopened` where its topic is in progress again — then the headings its excerpt sits under, joined by ` › `; the excerpt, the passage of the matching chunk closest to the query, or its opening lines where no line shares the query's words; and its `Source:` path with the chunk's line range (`path:L3-39`). Where the file no longer holds the chunk — edited since it was indexed — the headings line is absent and the path is bare. `[0 results]` means no prior context was found: move on. Notes above the count say why the query ran keyword-only, that chunks still await vectors, why the last vector fill fell short, or that a knowledge config setting was ignored. The results stand either way and the query exits `0`; there is nothing to relay — a start's warnings tell the person what needs them.

Excerpts land in context; read further only when a result looks load-bearing — its source file at the result's line range, or, where the path is bare, around the passage its excerpt comes from. Most queries return a couple of mildly relevant results and one directly relevant — read that one, and skim the rest from their excerpts alone.

Confidence is intrinsic to the source phase — how much weight to give the content, never whether to use it:

- `high` — specification: a decision validated and written down. Trust the *what*; verify the *why* against the source when it matters.
- `medium` — investigation: diagnostic work tied to specific symptoms. Trust the diagnosis; check the symptom is still current.
- `low-medium` — discussion: conversational, may carry assumptions corrected later in the same file. Read for context, not conclusions.
- `low` — research, imports, seeds, analysis, discovery, roadmap, baseline: exploration, reference material, raw captures and derived summaries, never validated decisions; the provenance line's phase says which.

Low confidence is not low value. A research result that rejected an approach stops the next work unit re-exploring the same dead end; a discussion result showing a corrected assumption explains *why* the spec says what it says. Weigh them, never filter them out.

A `reopened` result is its topic's last concluded position, now being revisited — it may change.

A `[baseline | …]` hit is the project baseline — observed and user-stated context about the codebase as the workflows found it. Reference, never record: it informs the conversation, but it never settles a decision the way a discussion or specification result does, and a stated rationale worth building on is confirmed with the user rather than silently assumed current. Baseline chunks also never decay — a claim the code has since outgrown is worth flagging to the user rather than trusting it to fade.

A `[roadmap | …]` hit is the product-level record — a roadmap session's exploration, staged thinking about capabilities that may never have been pulled. Exploration-grade, never a decision of record, and it may carry ground a pull's fence deliberately left behind: material beyond the work unit's pulled items informs the conversation but never silently widens the work's scope.

## D. Query failure handling

If `knowledge query` exits with a non-zero code, **pause the workflow**. Do not silently proceed without context — the knowledge base is high-value enough that silent skips are worse than a brief interruption. Write the command's error output, verbatim, to `{session_cache}/query-failure.json` with the Write tool — `{"error": "{the error output}"}` — where `{session_cache}` is the calling session's cache: `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/{phase}/{topic}` in a phase session, `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/discovery` in a discovery session, `.workflows/.cache/roadmap` in a roadmap session. Then fetch the gate, emitting each section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render query-failure-gate --file {session_cache}/query-failure.json
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `retry`

Re-run the query.

**If it fails again:**

→ Return to **D. Query failure handling**.

**If it succeeds:**

The caller interprets the fresh results.

→ Return to caller.

#### If `skip`

Continue the phase, recording that knowledge retrieval was skipped so the user knows context may be missing: note it in the current phase's working file. Example: append a short note under a relevant section — *"Knowledge base query skipped ({YYYY-MM-DD}) — prior context may be missing."* — so the user can audit later.

→ Return to caller.

## E. When a surfaced artifact is wrong

A result (or its source file) can carry a claim you have verified is wrong or has shifted since it was written. What happens next depends on the source phase.

#### If the source is a specification

Never leave it standing — the spec is the golden record and its chunks stay live at full confidence, so every future query re-serves the error as validated context.

→ Load **[correcting-historical-artifacts.md](correcting-historical-artifacts.md)** and follow its instructions.

#### If the source is any other phase

Leave the artifact alone — no correction is owed. Everything outside the specification decays in the knowledge base; record what is actually true in the current work's own artifact and let the stale claim age out.

→ Return to caller.

## F. Phase-specific notes

- **Research** — query at the start of the phase (via the contextual query step) and throughout. Early phases have the highest chance of overlapping with prior work — research is often where the same ground gets explored twice if we don't check.
- **Discussion** — query at the start and throughout. Decisions being made now often echo or contradict decisions made elsewhere. Check before committing to a direction.
- **Investigation** — query at the start (after initial symptoms are gathered) and throughout. Symptoms and root causes may have been seen before — a matching prior investigation can save hours.
- **Specification** — **do not query while authoring the spec.** The spec turns discussion decisions into a golden document. Cross-cutting concerns merge at planning time via an explicit cross-cutting query, not during spec authoring. Querying mid-spec pulls the document away from its own source material. Exception: the grouping/consolidation analysis at specification *entry* may run one advisory `--phase discussion` query to surface candidate consult references (sibling discussions owing a correction) — that is intake, not authoring, and never injects content into the spec body.
- **Scoping** — query throughout. Quick-fix scoping benefits from knowing if the issue was discussed or investigated elsewhere — a "mechanical change" often has a history.
- **Planning** — **do not query during planning.** The spec is the golden document; planning operates on the spec alone. A spec gap that surfaces during planning is classified and landed through the planning flow (`resolve-spec-gap.md`) — never filled with a KB query. Cross-cutting context is handled at planning entry via the explicit `--work-type cross-cutting` query (existing mechanism, not discretionary).
- **Implementation** — code is the source of truth for *what* exists during implementation. Read the code; don't query the KB for it. The KB is useful only for the *why* behind an existing pattern or decision (e.g., "why does this use UUID v7?" — the rationale lives in spec/discussion, not the code). Rare in practice. Never use it to fill spec gaps — those are blockers.
- **Review** — query only for cross-work-unit consistency checks ("does this mirror how similar decisions were made elsewhere?"). Consistency with the current spec is already in scope — no KB needed for that.

## G. Sibling consult at cross-topic decision points

A decision is deciding on ground another document may own when either trigger holds:

- **A term this artifact didn't introduce** — the decision names an entity, field, rule, or classification this topic's own artifact didn't introduce. The trigger is local — whether this artifact introduced the term is checkable against the current file; whether another document owns it is exactly what the consult finds out. **Citation is not introduction**: a term this artifact only carries by citing another topic's decision was introduced there, and a new decision naming it triggers the consult however familiar the term reads in this file.
- **Re-decided ground** — at an engagement decision point (below), the outcome re-decides ground this topic had already `decided`, whatever terms it names: a sibling may have built on the decision it replaces.

Before documenting such a decision:

1. **Consult** — run a scoped query for the term or the re-decided ground, or cite the sibling's current decided text when it is already in this session's context.
2. **Trace** — record the check as one line inside the documented decision, whether the consult queried or cited: `Sibling check: {topic} — {what its decided text holds}`, or `Sibling check: no overlap found.`

When the consult surfaces text the new decision contradicts or supersedes, route by owner. Text that *anticipates* the decision — a lean recorded as a lean, a question the sibling deferred or triaged to this topic — is neither: the deferral is its forward pointer, nothing is owed, and no reroute fires. A sibling topic in the same epic: reroute through the session's off-topic path at that moment. Another work unit's specification: it is owed a correction — never a prose note to carry — follow **E. When a surfaced artifact is wrong**. Any other document of another work unit: no correction is owed — this topic's own record of the decision stands, and the stale text ages out (**E**'s non-spec arm).

In ordinary conversation the first trigger is the same advisory judgment as §A trigger 2. At engagement decision points — a review or synthesis finding's outcome, a rerouted triage concern's fold — both triggers apply and the consult is a required step; the engagement flows name it.

→ Return to caller.
