# Closing Gates

*Reference for **[discussion-session](discussion-session.md)** — loaded when the discussion reaches its close, with every subtopic settled (deferrals already applied) and the topic's waits already checked.*

---

The passage from conversation to conclusion runs two gates: the **review gate** — is a review still owed, or one more worth offering, and does the user want it — then the **conclude gate**. Nothing here proceeds silently: whatever the classification, the user hears what comes next and answers.

The triage queue precedes both gates — a queued concern is work the conclusion cannot pass, and a review dispatched over it would read a document the walk is about to move. Check it first:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs topic queue {work_unit} discussion {topic}
```

**If `count` is non-zero:**

Render the blocker and emit both its sections verbatim per their markers — the red blocker line, then its guidance:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render triage-block {work_unit}.discussion.{topic}
```

→ Return to caller for **B. Session Loop**.

**If `count` is `0`:**

→ Proceed to **A. Classify**.

## A. Classify

Read the agent store:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs agent scan {work_unit} discussion {topic}
```

Classify what the final-review step still owes — first match wins:

1. Any `review`, `synthesis`, or `perspective` row is `pending` or `acknowledged` → **findings-owed**: "background findings are still to be walked through"
2. Any `review` row is `in-flight` → **review-running**: "a dispatched review is still running"
3. No `review` row exists → **never-reviewed**: "no review has run yet"
4. Otherwise the highest-numbered `review` row is `incorporated` — classify by movement, anchored on the last **real** review: the highest-numbered `review` row whose report exists on disk (`.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}/{id}.md`, non-empty). An `incorporated` row with no report is a killed dispatch closed as bookkeeping, never a review — anchoring on it would hide every commit between the real review and the kill. If no review row has a report, no review has ever completed → **never-reviewed**. Otherwise run `git log --since='{created}' --format='%h %s' -- .workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}.md` (`{created}` = the anchor row's `created` timestamp; git does the time comparison), then drop commits whose subject carries a `review-` or `synthesis-` drain marker (e.g. `(review-003 F2)`) or a `(deferral)` marker — engagement writes and the conclusion's own deferral write are not new work. Classify the residue:
   1. No commits remain → **satisfied**: the final review is up to date — no judgment
   2. A remaining commit is meaningful — a decision documented, a subtopic explored; not typo fixes, not bookkeeping (document-review reconciliation, summary maintenance) → **re-review**: the discussion has moved since the last review
   3. Otherwise → **satisfied** — doubt resolves here; declining forfeits nothing, a later attempt reclassifies

   A commit carrying both — a decision documented alongside bookkeeping in one write — is meaningful; the bookkeeping it travels with does not neutralise it. Genuine doubt about whether the substance is a decision at all still resolves at 4.3.

Step 6 (Final Gap Review) is the executor and re-derives state itself — a classification mismatch here is cosmetic, never state-corrupting.

#### If the classification is `re-review`

→ Proceed to **B. Review Gate — Optional**.

#### If the classification is `satisfied`

No review to offer — the conclude gate is next.

→ Proceed to **D. Conclude Gate**.

#### Otherwise

`findings-owed`, `review-running`, and `never-reviewed` all mean the final review still owes its mandatory pass.

→ Proceed to **C. Review Gate — Mandatory**.

## B. Review Gate — Optional

A review has already run and drained; declining another forfeits nothing owed. Fetch the gate and emit its MENU section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render closing-gate {work_unit}.discussion.{topic} --variant re-review
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Proceed to **E. In-Flight Agent Check**.

**If `no`:**

One more review is declined for this conclusion attempt — Step 6 honours the decline, and a later attempt classifies afresh and offers again.

→ Proceed to **D. Conclude Gate**.

**If keep going:**

→ Return to caller for **B. Session Loop**.

## C. Review Gate — Mandatory

At least one full review pass belongs to every discussion — this one cannot be skipped, only postponed by keeping the conversation open.

#### If the classification is `findings-owed`

Nothing new runs on `yes` — background findings have already come back, and Step 6 walks them. The gate says that plainly, so "another review" is never the reading the user answers to. Fetch it and emit its MENU section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render closing-gate {work_unit}.discussion.{topic} --variant findings-owed
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Proceed to **E. In-Flight Agent Check**.

**If keep going:**

→ Return to caller for **B. Session Loop**.

#### Otherwise

`{reason}` is the matched classification's quoted description. Fetch the gate and emit its MENU section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render closing-gate {work_unit}.discussion.{topic} --variant final-review --reason "{reason}"
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Proceed to **E. In-Flight Agent Check**.

**If keep going:**

→ Return to caller for **B. Session Loop**.

## D. Conclude Gate

Fetch the gate and emit its MENU section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render closing-gate {work_unit}.discussion.{topic} --variant wrap-up
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Proceed to **E. In-Flight Agent Check**.

**If `no`:**

→ Return to caller for **B. Session Loop**.

## E. In-Flight Agent Check

The last gate before leaving the session, whichever path led here. Run `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs agent scan {work_unit} discussion {topic}` and read the response's `in_flight` list (agents dispatched but not yet returned). An agent dispatched by an earlier session cannot still be running — each row's `created` timestamp tells you which those are; close each (`agent incorporate`), re-scan, and count only this session's. A dead `synthesis` row is the exception: handle it per **D. Check and Surface** in **[perspective-agents.md](perspective-agents.md)** — closed *and* re-dispatched, so the council's tensions aren't lost.

#### If no agents are in flight

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 6**.

#### If agents are still running

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render in-flight-agents-gate {work_unit}.discussion.{topic} --count {N}
```

Emit the call's MENU section verbatim per its marker.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `wait`:**

Watch for `agent scan` to promote each in-flight row to `pending`. When none remain in flight, delegate surfacing to the surfacing protocol loaded by review-agent.md and perspective-agents.md. The protocol applies the never-dump rules: two-phase surfacing, one finding at a time. Treat the current moment as a natural break — we are at phase conclusion, so the break check will pass.

→ Return to caller for **B. Session Loop**.

**If `proceed`:**

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 6**.
