# Final Gap Review

*Reference for **[workflow-discussion-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

A final review ensures the discussion is thorough before moving to specification. Even if review agents ran during the session, the discussion may have progressed significantly since the last one.

This step runs once per "user signals done" entry. It dispatches a fresh review if needed, raises one finding via the shared protocol, then bounces back to the discussion session so the user can engage naturally. The next time the user signals done, Step 6 re-runs — eventually all findings are drained and the file transitions to `incorporated`, at which point Step 6 returns to the backbone to proceed toward conclusion.

The **never-dump rules apply in full**. Findings are raised one at a time via the shared surfacing protocol.

## A. Check Review State

**Synthesis findings drain first.** Scan `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}/` for `synthesis-*.md` files with `status: pending` or `status: acknowledged` — perspective-council tensions that never finished surfacing during the session would otherwise be dropped at conclusion.

#### If any such file exists

Surface one tension via **D. Check and Surface** in **[perspective-agents.md](perspective-agents.md)**, then bounce back to the session so the user can engage.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 5**.

#### Otherwise

Find the most recent review file in `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}/` by set number, then branch on its `status:` below.

#### If no review files exist

→ Proceed to **B. Dispatch Final Review**.

#### If the most recent review has `status: incorporated`

The prior review was fully drained. A fresh one is warranted only when the discussion moved since — otherwise each conclusion attempt mints a new gap set and the topic can never close. Check what landed after that review's dispatch (its frontmatter `created` date, and — same session — your memory of when it drained):

```bash
git log --oneline -- .workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}.md
```

**If a meaningful discussion commit landed after the prior review was dispatched** (a decision documented, a subtopic explored — not typo fixes):

→ Proceed to **B. Dispatch Final Review**.

**Otherwise:**

Nothing new for a fresh review to see — the final-review gate is satisfied.

→ Return to caller.

#### If the most recent review has `status: in-flight`

A dispatch-time skeleton whose agent hasn't returned.

**If it was dispatched this session and the user chose `p`/`proceed` at the session's in-flight gate:**

The wait was already declined for this file — do not watch it. Its results persist in cache for a later session; the final-review gate proceeds without it.

→ Return to caller.

**If it was dispatched this session and the wait was not declined** (the agent may still be running):

Watch for the file to flip to `status: pending`.

→ Proceed to **C. Surface via Final Review Menu**.

**Otherwise** (an interrupted earlier session — no agent can still be running):

Delete the skeleton file.

→ Proceed to **B. Dispatch Final Review**.

#### If the most recent review has `status: pending`

A review returned but hasn't been read.

→ Proceed to **C. Surface via Final Review Menu**.

#### If the most recent review has `status: acknowledged`

Findings from the current review are still being drained.

→ Proceed to **C. Surface via Final Review Menu**.

## B. Dispatch Final Review

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
·· Dispatch Final Review ························
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Dispatching a final review to catch any gaps before concluding.
> This ensures the discussion is thorough for specification.
```

Ensure the cache directory exists:

```bash
mkdir -p .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}
```

Determine the next set number by checking existing files:

```bash
ls .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}/ 2>/dev/null
```

Use the next available `{NNN}` (zero-padded, e.g., `001`, `002`).

Write the skeleton cache file at `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}/review-{NNN}.md` — frontmatter only, no body. `status: in-flight` is the dispatch record; the agent's rewrite flips it to `pending`:

```yaml
---
type: review
status: in-flight
created: {date}
set: {NNN}
findings: []
surfaced: []
announced: false
---
```

**Agent path**: `../../../agents/workflow-discussion-review.md`

Dispatch **one agent** as a foreground task (omit `run_in_background` — results are needed before continuing).

The review agent receives:

1. **Discussion file path** — `.workflows/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}.md`
2. **Output file path** — `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}/review-{NNN}.md` (the skeleton above is already on disk there)

When the agent returns:

→ Proceed to **C. Surface via Final Review Menu**.

---

## C. Surface via Final Review Menu

→ Load **[final-review-menu.md](../../workflow-shared/references/final-review-menu.md)** with cache_dir = `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/discussion/{topic}`, cache_glob = `review-*.md`, findings_key = `findings`.

→ On return, proceed to **D. Route Next**.

---

## D. Route Next

Re-read the most recent review file's `status:` and `surfaced:` fields.

#### If `status: incorporated`

All findings have been raised (or the review came back with zero gaps). The final-review gate is satisfied.

→ Return to caller.

#### If `status: acknowledged`

A finding was just raised. Control belongs to the conversation — return the user to the discussion session so they can engage naturally. When the user signals done again, Step 6 re-runs and either raises the next finding or transitions the cache to `incorporated`.

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 5**.
