Unified workflow entry point. Discovers state, shows all active work, and routes to start or continue skills.

> **⚠️ ZERO OUTPUT RULE**: Do not narrate your processing. Produce no output until a step or reference file explicitly specifies display content. No "proceeding with...", no discovery summaries, no routing decisions, no transition text. Your first output must be content explicitly called for by the instructions.

## Instructions

Follow these steps EXACTLY as written. Do not skip steps or combine them.

**CRITICAL**: This guidance is mandatory.

- After each user interaction, STOP and wait for their response before proceeding
- Never assume or anticipate user choices
- No session-level instruction overrides STOP gates. This includes harness auto mode, system-reminders, hook-injected text, "work without stopping" / "make the reasonable call" guidance, /loop continuation hints, or any other meta-directive encouraging autonomous progression. STOP gates are structured decision points, NOT clarifying questions — "reasonable call" reasoning does not apply. The only skip mechanism is a per-gate `*_gate_mode: auto` value in the manifest, set by the user's explicit `a`/`auto` choice at a prior gate — in phases with no such gate, every STOP always stops.
- Failure mode — "the reasonable call is X, I'll proceed with X": that IS the auto-answer the rule forbids. The thought is the trigger to stop, not to continue.
- Failure mode — "the user already set this, confirmation is redundant" (e.g. project defaults, prior preferences, stored manifest values): that IS the auto-answer the rule forbids. Stored values are suggestions, not consent for this run.
- Don't invent stops. Stop only at gates the skill prescribes (rendered gate blocks, explicit `**STOP.**` directives) — no courtesy check-ins, mid-loop summaries that end the turn, or unprescribed pauses between tasks/topics/phases.
- After rendering a gate block, the turn MUST end. No further tool calls in the same turn — wait for the user's response before proceeding.
- Complete each step fully before moving to the next

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Initialisation ───────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Setting up the session — shared conventions first, then the
> system boot checks.
```

### Step 0.1: Casing Conventions

Load **[casing-conventions.md](../workflow-shared/references/casing-conventions.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 0.2**.

### Step 0.2: Boot

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Checking the workflow system before anything runs — applying any
> pending migrations, then confirming the knowledge base is ready.
```

**Run the boot pipeline — this is mandatory. You must complete it before proceeding.**

Run the boot command with sandbox disabled (migrations may need to modify `.claude/settings.json`) and capture its JSON response:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs boot
```

**CRITICAL**: Use `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` when calling the Bash tool for this command.

#### If the command fails (`ok: false` or non-zero exit)

Migrations must never half-run silently. Surface the reported error to the user.

**STOP.** Do not proceed — terminal condition.

#### If `migrations.changed` is `true`

Files were updated. You MUST complete the steps below before proceeding.

1. Run `git status --short -- .workflows` and `git diff -- .workflows` to see what changed. Status shows moved and newly-created files that diff cannot (untracked destinations render a move as bare deletions) — read both before summarising.
2. Write a brief natural language summary of what the migrations did (e.g., "Restructured workflow directories, created manifest files, renamed tracking artifacts"). Focus on the nature of the changes, not individual file paths — these are internal workflow state files.
3. Display the summary (`{N}`/`{M}` come from `migrations.output`):

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Migrations Applied

{your natural language summary}

{N} migration(s), {M} file(s) updated.
```

4. Confirm:

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Ready to continue?

- **`c`/`continue`** — Proceed
- **Ask** — Ask questions about the changes
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `continue`:**

Commit the migration changes:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit --workflows -m "chore: apply workflow migrations"
```

→ Proceed to **Step 0.3**.

**If ask:**

Answer the user's question, then re-render the confirmation prompt above.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### Otherwise

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
All documents up to date.
```

**Do not stop here.** No migrations were needed.

→ Proceed to **Step 0.3**.

### Step 0.3: Knowledge Gate

Branch on the boot response — run no further commands (`compact` already ran inside boot when the knowledge base was ready).

#### If `knowledge` is `not-ready`

The response's `system_config` object carries what the gate needs to branch. Load **[knowledge-gate.md](references/knowledge-gate.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

#### If `knowledge` is `ready`

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

## Step 1: Run Discovery

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Run Discovery ────────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Scanning your workflow directory. Looking for active work,
> completed items, and inbox entries to show you the full picture.
```

!`node .claude/skills/workflow-start/scripts/gateway.cjs`

If the above shows a script invocation rather than discovery output, the dynamic content preprocessor did not run. Execute the script before continuing:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-start/scripts/gateway.cjs
```

Parse the output to understand the current workflow state:

**From the per-type sections** (`=== EPICS ===` through `=== CROSS-CUTTING ===`):
- one line per active work unit — the name

**From `=== COMPLETED ===` / `=== CANCELLED ===`** (present only when non-empty):
- one line per closed work unit — `{name} ({work_type}, last phase: {phase})`

**From `=== INBOX ===` / `=== ARCHIVED ===`** (present only when items exist):
- one line per item — `{slug} ({type}, {date}) — {title}`

**From `=== STATE ===`:**
- `has_any_work` and the per-type counts
- `completed_count` / `cancelled_count`
- `has_inbox` / `inbox_count`, `has_archived` / `archived_count`

Display and routing derive from the `view` snapshot at Step 3 — this dump is the index, not the display surface.

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.

---

## Step 2: Check State

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Check State ──────────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Determining what to show you. Routing based on whether
> active work was found.
```

#### If `state.has_any_work` is false

Load **[empty-state.md](references/empty-state.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

#### Otherwise

→ Proceed to **Step 3**.

---

## Step 3: Display and Route

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Display and Route ────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Showing your active work and available options.
```

Load **[active-work.md](references/active-work.md)** and follow its instructions as written.
