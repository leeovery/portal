# Inbox Working Set

*Reference for **[workflow-start](../SKILL.md)***

---

Build and act on a set of inbox items. The caller holds the **working set** — one or more items, each with a type and inbox path. Every action applies to the whole set; `d`/`drop` is the only way to narrow it. `w`/`work` carries the set into discovery as combined seed material.

## A. Render the Working Set

Fetch the working-set snapshot — pass every held item's inbox path, in set order:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-start/scripts/gateway.cjs working-set {path} [{path} …]
```

The response carries demarcated sections:

- **DATA** — reasoning surface: `set_uniform` / `set_type`, `addable_count`, and the `SET` and `ADDABLE` tables — one line per item, `n  type  date  slug  → path`. Reason from it; never display or restate it.
- **MENU** — the set menu. Emit verbatim as markdown (not a code block) at this section's gate below. The `w`/`work` option renders only for a type-uniform set.
- **Labelled sections** (`DISPLAY: add candidates`, `MENU: add gate`, `DISPLAY: drop candidates`, `MENU: drop gate`) — deferred: each is emitted only at the gate its marker names (**B** / **C**), never here.

For each item in the set, read its file and synthesise a short summary — what the item is and why it matters, in product terms (do not quote it verbatim). Hold each item's title (the file's `#` heading, falling back to its slug).

```
  Working Set ({count} item{s}) — actions apply to all of them
@if(set_uniform is false)

  ⚑ Work is unavailable while the set mixes types — drop to a single
    type to enable it.
@endif

@foreach(item in working_set)
  {branch}• {item.title} ({item.type})
@foreach(line in wrap(item.summary, 65))
  {gutter}{line}
@endforeach
@endforeach
```

**Render rules:**

- **Item row**: `{branch}• {item.title} ({item.type})`. `{branch}` is `┌─ ` for the first item, `└─ ` for the last, `├─ ` for the rest (trailing space included). **With a single item, `{branch}` is empty** — render `• {item.title}` with no connector; a lone `└─` would join nothing. The `•` is a fixed marker, not a status icon.
- **Flag spacing**: the `⚑` block carries one blank line above and one below. The blank inside `@if` supplies the upper gap; the blank after `@endif` supplies the lower. When no flag renders, only the lower blank remains — the title-to-items gap stays a single line, never doubled.
- **Summary sub-lines**: hard-wrap at 65 characters, capped at **3 lines** — if it would run longer, truncate the third line with `…` (`v`/`view` shows the full text). Each line is indented **two columns past the title text** so the description reads as subordinate, not aligned directly under the title.
  - **`{gutter}`** (the template's 2-space lead precedes it): non-last item → `│` then 6 spaces; last item → 7 spaces (no `│`); single item → 4 spaces. The `│` sits under the branch character and runs continuously through every sub-line of non-last items so the tree never breaks.

Emit the MENU section.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

The user types a shorthand (`w`/`a`/`d`/`r`/`v`/`b`) **or** describes the action in their own words. Map the response to one branch below; a message that only asks about the set, naming no action, is `Ask`. When the phrasing also names items (*"add 2 and 4"*, *"drop the bug"*), carry that selection into the action so **B**/**C** apply it without re-prompting. `w`/`work` can only be chosen when the menu offered it (`set_uniform` is `true`).

#### If user chose `w`/`work`

→ Proceed to **F. Work the Set**.

#### If user chose `a`/`add`

→ Proceed to **B. Add Items**.

#### If user chose `d`/`drop`

→ Proceed to **C. Drop Items**.

#### If user chose `r`/`archive`

→ Proceed to **D. Archive the Set**.

#### If user chose `v`/`view`

→ Proceed to **E. View Full Content**.

#### If user chose `b`/`back`

→ Return to caller.

#### If user asked a question

Answer from the set items' content. Keep it short. Do not act on the set — the menu is always the next thing shown.

→ Return to **A. Render the Working Set**.

## B. Add Items

The `ADDABLE` table in the working-set DATA lists the inbox items not already in the set.

#### If `addable_count` is 0

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
  Every inbox item is already in the set.
```

→ Return to **A. Render the Working Set**.

#### If the triggering message already named the item(s) to add

Match each named item against the `ADDABLE` table — by title, or by the number if the user referenced one. If any reference is ambiguous or unmatched, treat the request as unmatched and follow **Otherwise** below. Otherwise append the matched items' paths to the working set.

→ Return to **A. Render the Working Set**.

#### Otherwise

Emit the `DISPLAY: add candidates` section verbatim as a code block, then the `MENU: add gate` section verbatim as markdown (not a code block).

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If user chose `b`/`back`:**

→ Return to **A. Render the Working Set**.

**If user chose one or more numbers:**

Resolve each chosen number to its `ADDABLE` row and append the row's path to the working set.

→ Return to **A. Render the Working Set**.

## C. Drop Items

#### If the triggering message already named the item(s) to drop

Resolve each named item against the working set by title or description. If any reference is ambiguous or unmatched, treat the request as unmatched and follow **Otherwise** below. Otherwise remove the resolved items (they stay in the inbox):

**If the set is now empty:**

→ Return to caller.

**If items remain:**

→ Return to **A. Render the Working Set**.

#### Otherwise

Emit the `DISPLAY: drop candidates` section verbatim as a code block, then the `MENU: drop gate` section verbatim as markdown (not a code block).

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If user chose `b`/`back`:**

→ Return to **A. Render the Working Set**.

**If user chose one or more numbers:**

Resolve each chosen number to its `SET` row and remove that item from the working set; it stays in the inbox. If the set is now empty, → Return to caller; otherwise → Return to **A. Render the Working Set**.

## D. Archive the Set

Archive every item in the working set out of the inbox — one command moves each file into `.archived/` under its inbox folder and commits the whole set:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs inbox archive {path} [{path} …]
```

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Archived {count} item{s} from the inbox.
```

The working set is now empty.

→ Return to caller.

## E. View Full Content

Read each item in the set and render its full content.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
@foreach(item in working_set)
  ── {item.title} ({item.type}) ──

  {item.full_content}

@endforeach
```

→ Return to **A. Render the Working Set**.

## F. Work the Set

Reached only for a type-uniform set — `w`/`work` is offered solely when `set_uniform` is `true`. The DATA `set_type` is the work-type pre-seed (all bugs → `bugfix`, all quick-fixes → `quick-fix`, all ideas → `none`).

Build `inbox_seeds` — the set items' inbox paths, comma-joined.

→ Load **[route-to-discovery.md](route-to-discovery.md)** with work_type = `{set_type}`, inbox_seeds = `{inbox_seeds}`.
