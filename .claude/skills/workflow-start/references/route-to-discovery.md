# Route to Discovery

*Reference for **[workflow-start](../SKILL.md)***

---

Hand new work to discovery. Every new-work pick routes here — the work type is a pre-seed (a hint discovery still confirms), or `none` for the unknown-shape `s/start` path.

Parameters the caller provides via context before loading:

- `work_type` — `epic` / `feature` / `bugfix` / `quick-fix` / `cross-cutting`, or `none`.
- `inbox_seeds` — comma-joined path(s) of the chosen inbox file(s), one or more, or `none`.

→ Load **[handing-off.md](../../workflow-shared/references/handing-off.md)** with route = `/workflow-discovery {work_type} none "{inbox_seeds}"`.
