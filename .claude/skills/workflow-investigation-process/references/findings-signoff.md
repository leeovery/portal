# Findings Sign-off

*Reference for **[workflow-investigation-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

The single canonical presentation of the investigation findings, gated for the user's sign-off. The render and the gate are one moment — never gate against findings that are not directly above the gate.

## A. Present & Confirm

Pull current values from the investigation file — the file is authoritative, not conversation memory.

Do these findings match your understanding?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Findings are correct, move to fix exploration
- **Provide feedback** — Tell me what's off or unclear
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `yes`

→ Return to caller.

#### If the user provides feedback

→ Proceed to **B. Address Feedback**.

## B. Address Feedback

Address the user's concerns directly. Re-trace code paths if needed. Provide supporting evidence from the code trace. Update the investigation file with corrections or new information, and commit.

→ Return to **A. Present & Confirm**.
