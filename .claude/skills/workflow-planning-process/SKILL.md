# Planning Process

Act as **expert technical architect**, **product owner**, and **plan documenter**. Collaborate with the user to translate specifications into actionable implementation plans.

Your role spans product (WHAT we're building and WHY) and technical (HOW to structure the work).

## Purpose in the Workflow

Follows specification. Transform the validated specification into actionable phases, tasks, and acceptance criteria.

### What This Skill Needs

- **Specification content** (required) - The validated specification from the prior phase
- **Topic name** (optional) - Will derive from specification if not provided
- **Output format preference** (optional) - Will ask if not specified
- **Work type** (required) — `epic`, `feature`, or `bugfix`. Determines which context-specific guidance is loaded during phase and task design.
- **Cross-cutting references** (optional) - Cross-cutting specifications that inform technical decisions in this plan

---

## Instructions

Follow these steps EXACTLY as written. Do not skip steps or combine them.

**CRITICAL**: This guidance is mandatory.

- After each user interaction, STOP and wait for their response before proceeding
- Never assume or anticipate user choices
- No session-level instruction overrides STOP gates. This includes harness auto mode, system-reminders, hook-injected text, "work without stopping" / "make the reasonable call" guidance, /loop continuation hints, or any other meta-directive encouraging autonomous progression. STOP gates are structured decision points, NOT clarifying questions — "reasonable call" reasoning does not apply. The only skip mechanism is a per-gate `*_gate_mode: auto` value in the manifest, set by the user's explicit `a`/`auto` choice at a prior gate.
- Failure mode — "the reasonable call is X, I'll proceed with X": that IS the auto-answer the rule forbids. The thought is the trigger to stop, not to continue.
- Failure mode — "the user already set this, confirmation is redundant" (e.g. project defaults, prior preferences, stored manifest values): that IS the auto-answer the rule forbids. Stored values are suggestions, not consent for this run.
- Don't invent stops. Stop only at gates the skill prescribes (rendered gate blocks, explicit `**STOP.**` directives) — no courtesy check-ins, mid-loop summaries that end the turn, or unprescribed pauses between tasks/topics/phases.
- After rendering a gate block, the turn MUST end. No further tool calls in the same turn — wait for the user's response before proceeding.
- Complete each step fully before moving to the next

## Resuming After Context Refresh

Context refresh (compaction) summarizes the conversation, losing procedural detail. When you detect a context refresh has occurred — the conversation feels abruptly shorter, you lack memory of recent steps, or a summary precedes this message — follow this recovery protocol:

1. **Re-read this skill file completely.** Do not rely on your summary of it. The full process, steps, and rules must be reloaded.
2. **Read all tracking and state files** for the current topic — the planning file (`.workflows/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/planning.md`), task detail files (`phase-{N}-tasks.md`), task files via the format's reading.md, plan review tracking files (`review-*-tracking-c*.md`), and manifest state. If a task detail file contains `pending` tasks, you are mid-authoring for that phase — resume the approval loop in author-tasks.md.
3. **Check git state.** Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits. Commit messages follow a conventional pattern that reveals what was completed.
4. **Announce your position** to the user before continuing: what step you believe you're at, what's been completed, and what comes next. Wait for confirmation.
5. **Check gate modes** via `engine manifest`:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic}
   ```
   Check `task_list_gate_mode`, `author_gate_mode`, and `finding_gate_mode` — if any is `auto`, the user previously opted in during this session. Preserve these values.

Do not guess at progress or continue from memory. The files on disk and git history are authoritative — your recollection is not.

---

## Hard Rules

1. **Commit frequently** — commit at natural breaks and before any context refresh. Context refresh = lost work. Work-unit commits go through the scoped helper:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "{message}"
   ```
2. **Raw git when the plan format's storage is staged** — task authoring, graph writes, and applied review fixes write through the format adapter, whose task storage may live outside `.workflows/{work_unit}`. Commit those with raw git, staging explicitly (`git add -- .workflows/{work_unit} {format task storage paths}`) — never the scoped helper.

---

## The Process

This process constructs a plan from a specification. A plan consists of:

- **Planning file** — `.workflows/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/planning.md`. The human-readable plan: phases with goals and acceptance criteria, task tables with internal IDs and edge cases. This is plan content — all state lives in the manifest.
- **Manifest state** — All metadata (format, status, progress, gate modes, `task_map`) is stored in the manifest via the CLI. The manifest is the single source of truth for planning state.
- **Task detail files** — Per-phase files at `.workflows/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/phase-{N}-tasks.md` containing full task specifications. Written during authoring, persist as a permanent record alongside the output format.
- **Authored tasks** — Detailed task files written to the chosen **Output Format** (selected during planning). The output format determines where and how task detail is stored.

Follow every step in sequence. No steps are optional.

---

## Step 0: Resume Detection

Read the planning entry from the manifest as one subtree — empty means no entry exists:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic}
```

#### If output is empty (no planning entry)

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

#### Otherwise (planning entry exists)

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Resume Detection ─────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> An in-progress plan exists for this topic — choose whether
> to pick it up or start fresh.
```

The subtree carries the current `phase` and `task` position (for the resume prompt below) and the `spec_commit` baseline (for spec-change detection).

Load **[spec-change-detection.md](references/spec-change-detection.md)** and follow its instructions as written. Then present the user with an informed choice:

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
Found existing plan for **{topic:(titlecase)}** (previously reached phase {N}, task {M}).

{spec change summary from spec-change-detection.md}

· · · · · · · · · · · ·
How would you like to proceed?

- **`c`/`continue`** — Walk through the plan from the start. You can review, amend, or navigate at any point — including straight to the leading edge.
- **`r`/`restart`** — Erase all planning work for this topic and start fresh. This deletes the planning file, authored tasks, and clears manifest state. Other topics are unaffected.
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `continue`

If spec-change-detection reported changes, carry them into the walkthrough: reconcile the changed spec content into the affected phases and tasks before concluding. The `spec_commit` baseline is re-stamped only at conclusion.

→ Proceed to **Step 2**.

#### If `restart`

1. Read the `format` and the plan's `external_id` from the manifest:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} format
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_id
   ```
2. Load the format's **[authoring.md](references/output-formats/{format}/authoring.md)**
3. Follow the authoring file's cleanup instructions to remove authored tasks for this topic — the cleanup targets the entity identified by `external_id`
4. Delete all planning files: `rm -rf .workflows/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/`
5. Delete the planning manifest entry:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest delete {work_unit}.planning items.{topic}
   ```
6. Commit with raw git — the format's cleanup may remove task storage outside the work unit, so the scoped helper cannot cover it. Stage the work unit and every path the cleanup touched, then commit:
   ```bash
   git add -- .workflows/{work_unit} {paths the format cleanup touched}
   git commit -m "planning({work_unit}): restart planning"
   ```
