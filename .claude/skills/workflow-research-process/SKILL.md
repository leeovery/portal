# Research Process

Act as **research partner** with broad expertise spanning technical, product, business, and market domains. Your role is learning, exploration, and discovery.

## Purpose in the Workflow

The exploration phase, entered from discovery — explore feasibility (technical, business, market), validate assumptions, and document findings before discussion begins.

**Stay in your lane**: Explore freely. This is the time for broad thinking, feasibility checks, and learning. Surface options and tradeoffs — don't make decisions. When a topic converges toward a conclusion, that's a signal it's ready for discussion phase, not a cue to start deciding. Park it and move on.

### What This Skill Needs

Positional arguments:
- `$0` — **work_type**: `epic`, `feature`, or `cross-cutting`. Determines session behaviour — epic sessions carry topic awareness and reroute a grown thread to its own topic; feature and cross-cutting use the single-topic session.
- `$1` — **work_unit**: the work unit name.
- `$2` — **topic**: what to research. A single-topic unit's topic is the work unit, so it may be left off: topic = `$2`, or `$1` where `work_type` is not `epic`.

## Instructions

Load **[framework.md](../workflow-shared/references/framework.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

## Resuming After Context Refresh

Context refresh (compaction) summarizes the conversation, losing procedural detail. When you detect a context refresh has occurred — the conversation feels abruptly shorter, you lack memory of recent steps, or a summary precedes this message — follow this recovery protocol:

1. **Re-read this skill file completely, then re-load [framework.md](../workflow-shared/references/framework.md).** Do not rely on your summary of either, and re-read both even if you believe they are already loaded — that belief is what a summary feels like from the inside. The full process, steps, and rules must be reloaded.
2. **Read all research files** in `.workflows/{work_unit}/research/`. These are the working documents this skill creates. Their content is your source of truth for progress. The thread register — what the topic set out to learn and where each question stands — lives in the manifest; read it with `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render research-threads {work_unit}.research.{topic}`.
3. **Check agent state.** Run `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs agent scan {work_unit} research {topic}` — `in_flight` deep dives still running, `pending` reports landed and not yet folded.
4. **Check git state.** Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits. Commit messages follow a conventional pattern that reveals what was completed.
5. **Announce your position** to the user before continuing: render the register (the call above — emit its DISPLAY section verbatim per its marker; an empty response means no thread is registered, so nothing is shown), state what step you believe you're at, what's been completed, and what comes next. Wait for confirmation.

Do not guess at progress or continue from memory. The files on disk and git history are authoritative — your recollection is not.

## Backlogging

The user says to put an idea aside — "roadmap it", "inbox it", "backlog that", "push it back" — and the words take this door whatever else is in flight. An idea, not a topic: a topic takes the postponing door. Load **[backlogging.md](../workflow-shared/references/backlogging.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, phase = `research`, from any point in the phase.

→ On return, resume the interrupted flow — a gate that was pending was set aside; once the exchange looks settled, ask in conversation whether the person is ready to move on, and on yes put it back — never fall through to Step 0.

---

## Postponing the Topic

The user pushes a topic back to the roadmap — "postpone this", "move the loyalty topic to v2", "take this whole topic back to the roadmap" — this one, or one on the map by name; `{name}` is that topic. The request is taken as said — never argued, and never checked back with a question first: load **[postponing-the-topic.md](../workflow-shared/references/postponing-the-topic.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, name = `{name}`, topic = `{topic}`, phase = `research`, from any point in the phase.

→ On return, resume the interrupted flow — a gate that was pending was set aside; once the exchange looks settled, ask in conversation whether the person is ready to move on, and on yes put it back — never fall through to Step 0.

---

## Cancelling the Topic

The user calls the topic off — they say to cancel, or the conversation agrees it is not worth pursuing. Never is not yet: a topic wanted later takes the postponing door. The call-off is taken as said — never argued, and never checked back with a question first: load **[cancelling-the-topic.md](../workflow-shared/references/cancelling-the-topic.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, phase = `research`, from any point in the phase.

→ On return, resume the interrupted flow — a gate that was pending was set aside; once the exchange looks settled, ask in conversation whether the person is ready to move on, and on yes put it back — never fall through to Step 0.

## Step 0: Resume Detection

Load **[ensure-discovery-item.md](../workflow-shared/references/ensure-discovery-item.md)** with work_type = `{work_type}`, work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, routing = `research`.

Refresh the tmux session label — a no-op unless the user opted in and this session runs inside tmux:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs session label {work_unit} research {topic}
```

Read the phase status, storing it as `phase_status`:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.research.{topic} status
```

#### If `phase_status` is empty or `triaged`

A first start, not a resume — no session has ever run. A `triaged` stub's parked concerns wait in the topic's triage queue, untouched by initialization — the session loop's triage check surfaces them.

Set `resumed` = `false`.

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

#### If `phase_status` is `in-progress` or `completed`

Where `phase_status` is `completed`, reopen it — resuming is not starting:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs topic reopen {work_unit} research {topic}
```

Render the phase note — `Reopening` for a topic just reopened, `Resuming` otherwise — and emit the section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render phase-note {work_unit}.research.{topic} --verb {Reopening|Resuming}
```

Load **[reconcile-advisory.md](../workflow-shared/references/reconcile-advisory.md)** with work_type = `{work_type}`, work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, downstream_phase = `research`.

**If no file exists at `.workflows/{work_unit}/research/{topic}.md`:**

A restart that never reached initialization — the earlier session's file is already gone.

Set `resumed` = `false`.

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

**Otherwise:**

Show the thread register so the continue-or-restart choice is informed:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render research-threads {work_unit}.research.{topic}
```

Emit the DISPLAY section verbatim per its marker. An empty response means no thread is registered; nothing is shown.

Load **[resume-detection.md](../workflow-shared/references/resume-detection.md)** with artifact = `research`, file = `.workflows/{work_unit}/research/{topic}.md`, continue_step = `Step 2`, restart_targets = `the research file, the manifest's thread register when the item carries one (node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest exists {work_unit}.research.{topic} threads, then manifest delete on true), and the phase cache directory (rm -rf .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/research/{topic}/ — content and agent state together) — a landed report would otherwise fold into the restarted session as its own`, commit = `research({work_unit}): restart research`.

Set `resumed` from where the reference returns: `true` for **Step 2**, the earlier session's file still standing; `false` for **Step 1**, its file deleted and rebuilt.

→ On return, proceed as the reference directed — `continue` lands on **Step 2**, `restart` on **Step 1**.

#### If `phase_status` is `postponed` or `cancelled`

Render the terminal blocker — the engine derives which from the item's status — and emit both sections verbatim per their markers:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render entry-gate {work_unit}.research.{topic} --own
```

**STOP.** Do not proceed — terminal condition.
