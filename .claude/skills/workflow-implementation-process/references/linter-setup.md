# Linter Setup

*Reference for **[workflow-implementation-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

Discover and configure project linters for use during the TDD cycle's LINT step. Linters run after every REFACTOR to catch mechanical issues (formatting, unused imports, type errors) that are cheaper to fix immediately than in review.

---

## A. Resolve Configuration

Read topic-level `linters` via `engine manifest`:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} linters
```

#### If `linters` is populated

Set `source` = `topic`.

→ Proceed to **B. Confirm Linters**.

#### Otherwise

Read the project-level default `linters` via `engine manifest`:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get project.defaults.linters
```

**If output is empty (never set):**

→ Proceed to **C. Discovery**.

**If output is a populated array:**

Set `source` = `project`.

→ Proceed to **B. Confirm Linters**.

**If output is `[]` (previously skipped):**

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Previous implementations skipped linters.
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Skip linters again?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Skip and proceed
- **`n`/`no`** — Run full linter discovery
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

→ Return to caller.

**If `no`:**

→ Proceed to **C. Discovery**.

---

## B. Confirm Linters

List the linters returned by the `source` level manifest query.

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Linters found:

  • {name} — {command}
  • ...
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Use these linters?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Use and proceed
- **`n`/`no`** — Re-discover linters
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `yes`

**If `source` is `project`:**

Copy to topic level:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} linters '[{project-level values}]'
```

→ Return to caller.

**If `source` is `topic`:**

→ Return to caller.

#### If `no`

Clear topic-level `linters` before re-discovery:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} linters '[]'
```

→ Proceed to **C. Discovery**.

---

## C. Discovery

Analyse the project to determine which linters are appropriate:

1. **Examine the project** — languages, frameworks, build tools, and existing configuration. Check package files, project skills in `.claude/skills/`, and any linter configs already present.
2. **Check installed tooling** — verify availability of candidate linters via the command line (e.g., `--version`). Check common install locations including package managers (brew, npm global, pip, cargo, etc.).
3. **Recommend a linter set** — based on project analysis and available tooling. Include install commands for any recommended tools that aren't yet installed.

Present discovery findings to the user:

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Linter discovery:

  • {tool} — {command} (installed / not installed)
  • ...

Recommendations: {any suggested tools with install commands}
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Approve these linters?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Approve and proceed
- **`c`/`change`** — Modify the linter list
- **`s`/`skip`** — Skip linter setup (no linting during TDD)
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

#### If `yes`

Store at topic and project level:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} linters '[...]'
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set project.defaults.linters '[...]'
```

→ Return to caller.

#### If `change`

Adjust based on user input.

→ Return to **C. Discovery**.

#### If `skip`

Store empty array at topic and project level:
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} linters '[]'
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set project.defaults.linters '[]'
```

→ Return to caller.
