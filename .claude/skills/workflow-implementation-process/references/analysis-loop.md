# Analysis Loop

*Reference for **[workflow-implementation-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

Each cycle follows stages A through H sequentially. Always start at **A. Cycle Gate**.

```
A. Cycle gate (record the cycle, warn if over the session limit)
B. Git checkpoint
C. Dispatch analysis agents → invoke-analysis.md
D. Dispatch synthesis agent → invoke-synthesizer.md
E. Approval overview
F. Process task (per-task approval loop)
G. Route on results
H. Create tasks in plan → invoke-task-writer.md
→ Route on result
```

---

## A. Cycle Gate

Record the cycle via the engine (increments both the lifetime and session counters):
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs task analysis-cycle {work_unit} {topic}
```

`{N}` and `{cycle-number}` throughout this loop refer to the response's `cycle_total`; **F. Process Task** branches on its `analysis_gate_mode`.

#### If the response's `over_session_limit` is `false`

→ Proceed to **B. Git Checkpoint**.

#### If the response's `over_session_limit` is `true`

**Do NOT skip analysis autonomously.** This gate is an escape hatch for the user — not a signal to stop. The expected default is to continue running analysis until no issues are found. Present the choice and let the user decide.

The response carries two rendered sections after its JSON line — emit each byte-for-byte where prescribed below: a section is everything beneath its `===` marker up to the next marker or the end of the response, the marker lines themselves never emitted. DISPLAY sections are emitted as a code block, MENU sections as markdown (not a code block).

Emit the response's `DISPLAY: cycle limit` section.

→ Load **[convergence-analysis.md](../../workflow-shared/references/convergence-analysis.md)** with loop_type = `analysis`, work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`.

Emit the response's `MENU: cycle gate` section.

You MUST NOT choose on the user's behalf.

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `proceed`:**

→ Proceed to **B. Git Checkpoint**.

**If `skip`:**

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 8**.

---

## B. Git Checkpoint

Ensure a clean working tree before analysis. Run `git status`.

#### If the working tree is clean

→ Proceed to **C. Dispatch Analysis Agents**.

#### If there are unstaged changes or untracked files

Categorize them:

- **Implementation files** (files touched by `impl({work_unit}):` commits) — stage these automatically.
- **Unexpected files** (files not touched during implementation) — present to the user:

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Pre-analysis checkpoint — unexpected files detected:
- {file} ({status: modified/untracked})
- ...
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
Include unexpected files in the checkpoint commit?

- **`y`/`yes`** — Include all
- **`s`/`skip`** — Exclude unexpected files, commit only implementation files
- **Comment** — Specify which to include
· · · · · · · · · · · ·
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

Stage all files (implementation and unexpected). Commit:
```
impl({work_unit}): pre-analysis checkpoint
```

→ Proceed to **C. Dispatch Analysis Agents**.

**If `skip`:**

Stage only implementation files. Leave unexpected files unstaged. Commit:
```
impl({work_unit}): pre-analysis checkpoint
```

→ Proceed to **C. Dispatch Analysis Agents**.

**If comment:**

Stage the files the user specified alongside implementation files. Commit:
```
impl({work_unit}): pre-analysis checkpoint
```

→ Proceed to **C. Dispatch Analysis Agents**.

---

## C. Dispatch Analysis Agents

→ Load **[invoke-analysis.md](invoke-analysis.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until all agents have returned.

Commit the analysis findings:

```
impl({work_unit}): analysis cycle {N} — findings
```

#### If all three agents returned `STATUS: clean`

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 8**.

#### Otherwise

→ Proceed to **D. Dispatch Synthesis Agent**.

---

## D. Dispatch Synthesis Agent

→ Load **[invoke-synthesizer.md](invoke-synthesizer.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until the synthesizer has returned.

Commit the synthesis output:

```
impl({work_unit}): analysis cycle {N} — synthesis
```

#### If `STATUS` is `clean`

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 8**.

#### If `STATUS` is `tasks_proposed`

→ Proceed to **E. Approval Overview**.

---

## E. Approval Overview

Read the staging file from `.workflows/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/analysis-tasks-c{cycle-number}.md`.

Write the overview payload to `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/tasks-overview.json` with the Write tool (`{"label": "Analysis cycle {N}", "tasks": [{"title": "…", "severity": "…"}]}`), render, and emit the section verbatim:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render tasks-overview {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} --file .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/tasks-overview.json
```

→ Proceed to **F. Process Task**.

---

## F. Process Task

#### If no pending tasks remain

→ Proceed to **G. Route on Results**.

#### Otherwise

Present the next pending task. Write its payload to `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/proposed-task.json` with the Write tool — `{"current": …, "total": …, "title": "…", "severity": "…", "sources": "…", "problem": "…", "solution": "…", "outcome": "…", "steps": […], "criteria": […], "tests": […]}` from the staging file — then render with the gate mode carried by this cycle's response (or `auto` if the user opted in at a previous task this cycle), and emit each section verbatim at its marked instruction:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render proposed-task {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} --file .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/implementation/{topic}/proposed-task.json --gate {analysis_gate_mode} --comment-hint "Provide feedback to adjust"
```

#### If the response carried `DISPLAY: task auto-approved`

Update `status: approved` in the staging file, then emit the section per its marker.

→ Return to **F. Process Task**.

#### If the response carried `MENU: task approval`

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `yes`:**

Update `status: approved` in the staging file.

→ Return to **F. Process Task**.

**If `auto`:**

Update `status: approved` in the staging file.

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.implementation.{topic} analysis_gate_mode auto
```

→ Return to **F. Process Task**.

**If `skip`:**

Update `status: skipped` in the staging file.

→ Return to **F. Process Task**.

**If comment:**

Revise the task content in the staging file based on the user's feedback.

→ Return to **F. Process Task**.

---

## G. Route on Results

#### If any tasks have `status: approved`

→ Proceed to **H. Create Tasks in Plan**.

#### If all tasks were skipped

Commit the staging file updates:

```
impl({work_unit}): analysis cycle {N} — tasks skipped
```

→ Return to **[the skill](../SKILL.md)** for **Step 8**.

---

## H. Create Tasks in Plan

→ Load **[invoke-task-writer.md](invoke-task-writer.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

> **CHECKPOINT**: Do not proceed until the task writer has returned.

Commit all analysis and plan changes:

```
impl({work_unit}): add analysis phase {N} ({K} tasks)
```

→ Return to caller.
