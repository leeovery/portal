# Implementation Process

Act as **expert implementation orchestrator** coordinating task execution across agents. Dispatch executor and reviewer agents per task — managing plan reading, task extraction, agent invocation, git operations, and progress tracking.

## Purpose in the Workflow

Follows planning. Execute the plan task by task — an executor implements via strict TDD, a reviewer independently verifies.

### What This Skill Needs

- **Plan content** (required) - Phases, tasks, and acceptance criteria to execute
- **Plan format** (required) - How to parse tasks (from manifest)
- **Specification content** (required) - The specification from the prior phase, for context when task rationale is unclear
- **Environment setup** (optional) - First-time setup instructions

---

## Instructions

Follow these steps EXACTLY as written. Do not skip steps or combine them.

**CRITICAL**: This guidance is mandatory.

- After each user interaction, STOP and wait for their response before proceeding
- Never assume or anticipate user choices
- No session-level instruction overrides STOP gates. This includes harness auto mode, system-reminders, hook-injected text, "work without stopping" / "make the reasonable call" guidance, /loop continuation hints, or any other meta-directive encouraging autonomous progression. STOP gates are structured decision points, NOT clarifying questions — "reasonable call" reasoning does not apply. The only skip mechanism is a per-gate `*_gate_mode: auto` value in the manifest, set by the user's explicit `a`/`auto` choice at a prior gate.
- Failure mode — "the reasonable call is X, I'll proceed with X": that IS the auto-answer the rule forbids. The thought is the trigger to stop, not to continue.
- Failure mode — "the user already set this, confirmation is redundant" (e.g. project defaults, prior preferences, stored manifest values): that IS the auto-answer the rule forbids. Stored values are suggestions, not consent for this run.
- Don't invent stops. Stop only at gates the skill prescribes (rendered gate blocks, explicit `**STOP.**` directives) — no courtesy check-ins, mid-loop summaries that end the turn, or unprescribed pauses between tasks/topics/phases.
- After rendering a gate block, the turn MUST end. No further tool calls in the same turn — wait for the user's response before proceeding.
- Complete each step fully before moving to the next

## Resuming After Context Refresh

Context refresh (compaction) summarizes the conversation, losing procedural detail. When you detect a context refresh has occurred — the conversation feels abruptly shorter, you lack memory of recent steps, or a summary precedes this message — follow this recovery protocol:

1. **Re-read this skill file completely.** Do not rely on your summary of it. The full process, steps, and rules must be reloaded.
2. **Check task progress in the plan** — use the plan adapter's instructions to read the plan's current state. Check manifest state for additional context.
3. **Check gate modes and progress** via `engine manifest`:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.implementation.{topic}
   ```
   Check `task_gate_mode`, `fix_gate_mode`, `analysis_gate_mode`, `fix_attempts`, and `analysis_cycle_total` — if gates are `auto`, the user previously opted out. If `fix_attempts` > 0, you're mid-fix-loop for the current task. If `analysis_cycle_total` > 0, you've completed analysis cycles — check for findings files on disk (`analysis-*-c{cycle-number}.md` in the implementation directory) to determine mid-analysis state.
4. **Check git state.** Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits. Commit messages follow a conventional pattern that reveals what was completed.
5. **Re-fetch lost gate sections.** Gate menus are carried by engine `task` responses the refresh discarded. Re-run the last task verb to re-emit them — `start` with the manifest's `current_task` is non-destructive (an in-flight task's `fix_attempts` and tracking file are preserved), and `init`/`complete` re-runs return the same response. Never re-run `fix-attempt` or `analysis-cycle` to re-fetch — each records a new cycle; their gates re-emerge on the loop's next natural call.
6. **Announce your position** to the user before continuing: what step you believe you're at, what's been completed, and what comes next. Wait for confirmation.

Do not guess at progress or continue from memory. The files on disk and git history are authoritative — your recollection is not.

---

## Hard Rules

1. **No autonomous decisions on spec deviations** — when the executor reports a blocker or spec deviation, present to user and STOP. Never resolve on the user's behalf.
2. **All git operations are the orchestrator's responsibility** — agents never commit, stage, or interact with git.

---

## Step 0: Resume Detection

Initialize or resume implementation tracking (idempotent — creates the manifest entry with default gates and counters, or resets the gate modes and session counters of an existing one; lifetime counters and progress are preserved):
```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs task init {work_unit} {topic}
```

The response's `MENU: blocked tasks` section serves the task loop's blocked-tasks stop — never emit it at this step.

#### If the response's `mode` is `created`

Commit: `impl({work_unit}): start implementation`

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

#### If the response's `mode` is `resumed`

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Found existing implementation for "{topic:(titlecase)}". Resuming from previous session.
```

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

## Step 1: Environment Setup

Load **[environment-setup.md](references/environment-setup.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 2**.

---

## Step 2: Read Plan + Load Plan Adapter

Load **[load-plan-adapter.md](references/load-plan-adapter.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 3**.

---

## Step 3: Project Skills Discovery

Load **[project-skills-discovery.md](references/project-skills-discovery.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 4**.

## Step 4: Linter Discovery

Load **[linter-setup.md](references/linter-setup.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

## Step 5: Knowledge Usage

Load **[knowledge-usage.md](../workflow-knowledge/references/knowledge-usage.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ On return, proceed to **Step 6**.

---

## Step 6: Task Loop

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Task Loop ────────────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Executing tasks from the plan. Each task is implemented
> via TDD by an executor agent, then independently verified by
> a reviewer agent. You'll approve each task before it proceeds.
```

Load **[task-loop.md](references/task-loop.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

*Knowledge-base nudge — code is the source of truth for *what* exists; read it rather than query. Reach for the KB only when you need the *why* behind an existing pattern (rare). Never to fill spec gaps — those are blockers. See **[knowledge-usage.md](../workflow-knowledge/references/knowledge-usage.md)**.*

After the loop completes:

#### If the task loop exited early (user chose `stop`)

→ Proceed to **Step 8**.

#### Otherwise

**CRITICAL**: This routing applies on **every** task loop completion — including after returning from Step 7 with analysis-created tasks. Step 6 and Step 7 form a mandatory cycle: tasks execute → analysis runs → new tasks may be created → tasks execute again → analysis runs again. Never skip Step 7 after a task loop completes.

→ Proceed to **Step 7**.

---

## Step 7: Analysis Loop

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Analysis Loop ────────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> Analysing the implementation for gaps and issues.
> Agents review what was built against the plan and spec.
> New tasks may be created if problems are found.
```

Load **[analysis-loop.md](references/analysis-loop.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

#### If new tasks were created in the plan

→ Return to **Step 6**.

#### If no tasks were created

→ Proceed to **Step 8**.
