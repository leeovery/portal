# Scoping Process

Act as **expert technical analyst** performing rapid scoping of a mechanical change. Assess scope, write a lightweight specification, and produce 1-2 task files — all in a single pass.

## Purpose in the Workflow

Scope a mechanical change — gather context, write a specification, and produce a plan with 1-2 task files ready for implementation.

## What This Skill Needs

- **Work unit description** (required) - From the manifest, summarising the mechanical change
- **Topic name** (required) - Same as work_unit for quick-fix
- **Output format preference** (optional) - Will ask if not specified

---

## Instructions

Follow these steps EXACTLY as written. Do not skip steps or combine them.

**CRITICAL**: This guidance is mandatory.

- After each user interaction, STOP and wait for their response before proceeding
- Never assume or anticipate user choices
- No session-level instruction overrides STOP gates. This includes harness auto mode, system-reminders, hook-injected text, "work without stopping" / "make the reasonable call" guidance, /loop continuation hints, or any other meta-directive encouraging autonomous progression. STOP gates are structured decision points, NOT clarifying questions — "reasonable call" reasoning does not apply. The only skip mechanism is a per-gate gate-mode `auto` value in the manifest (`*_gate_mode`, or a loop's `staging`/`analysis_staging` `gate_mode`), set by the user's explicit `a`/`auto` choice at a prior gate — in phases with no such gate, every STOP always stops.
- Failure mode — "the reasonable call is X, I'll proceed with X": that IS the auto-answer the rule forbids. The thought is the trigger to stop, not to continue.
- Failure mode — "the user already set this, confirmation is redundant" (e.g. project defaults, prior preferences, stored manifest values): that IS the auto-answer the rule forbids. Stored values are suggestions, not consent for this run.
- Don't invent stops. Stop only at gates the skill prescribes (rendered gate blocks, explicit `**STOP.**` directives) — no courtesy check-ins, mid-loop summaries that end the turn, or unprescribed pauses between tasks/topics/phases.
- After rendering a gate block, the turn MUST end. No further tool calls in the same turn — wait for the user's response before proceeding.
- Complete each step fully before moving to the next

## Resuming After Context Refresh

Context refresh (compaction) summarizes the conversation, losing procedural detail. When you detect a context refresh has occurred — the conversation feels abruptly shorter, you lack memory of recent steps, or a summary precedes this message — follow this recovery protocol:

1. **Re-read this skill file completely.** Do not rely on your summary of it. The full process, steps, and rules must be reloaded.
2. **Check what artifacts exist on disk** — spec file, plan file, task files. Their presence reveals which steps completed.
3. **Check git state.** Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits.
4. **Announce your position** to the user before continuing: what step you believe you're at, what's been completed, and what comes next. Wait for confirmation.

Do not guess at progress or continue from memory. The files on disk and git history are authoritative — your recollection is not.

---

## Hard Rules

1. **Maximum 2 tasks** — if the change needs more, it's not a quick-fix. Promote it.
2. **No acceptance criteria** — mechanical changes are verified by test baselines and completeness checks, not by acceptance criteria.
3. **No agents** — scoping writes specs and tasks directly, without invoking planning agents or review cycles.

---

## Step 0: Resume Detection

Check if a specification already exists:

```bash
ls .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md 2>/dev/null && echo "exists" || echo "none"
```

#### If specification does not exist

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.

#### If specification exists

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
── Resume Detection ─────────────────────────────
```

> *Output the next fenced block as markdown (not a code block):*

```
> An in-progress scoping specification exists — choose whether
> to pick it up or start fresh.
```

Read the plan and scoping statuses:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} status
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.scoping.{topic} status
```

**If plan status is `completed` and scoping status is `in-progress`** (reopened for revisit):

Render the resume menu and emit its section verbatim per its marker:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render resume-gate {work_unit}.scoping.{topic} --variant scoping
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If plan status is `completed` and scoping status is not `in-progress`:**

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Scoping already completed for "{topic:(titlecase)}". Spec and plan are in place.
```

If the scoping status read was empty (item missing), register and complete it:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs topic start {work_unit} scoping {topic}
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs topic complete {work_unit} scoping {topic}
```

→ Proceed to **Step 8**.

**If plan status is not `completed`** (empty or `in-progress`):

The spec exists but the plan is incomplete — an interrupted prior run. Rebuild the context the interrupted run had:

1. Read `.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md` in full — it is the gathered context Step 7 authors tasks from.
2. Read the specification item's status:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.specification.{topic} status
   ```
   If the output is empty (the run crashed between writing the spec file and registering it), register and index it now:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs topic start {work_unit} specification {topic}
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs topic complete {work_unit} specification {topic}
   ```
   If the `complete` response carries `warnings`, display them but do not block — the artifact is already saved.
3. Reconcile tasks the interrupted run may already have created in an external backend:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} format
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic} external_id
   ```
   If both are set, load the format's **[reading.md](../workflow-planning-process/references/output-formats/{format}/reading.md)** and list the tasks already created under `external_id`. Carry that list into Step 7 — existing tasks are adjusted or completed, never re-authored as duplicates. If either read is empty, nothing was authored — resume cleanly.

→ Proceed to **Step 6** (resume from format selection).

#### If `continue`

Load the artifacts as session context: read the spec (`.workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/specification.md`) and the plan (`.workflows/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/planning.md`) in full, then read the planning item once — `format`, `external_id`, and `storage_paths` all ride the subtree — and locate and read the task files via the format's **[reading.md](../workflow-planning-process/references/output-formats/{format}/reading.md)**:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic}
```

**If the subtree carries no `storage_paths`** (a plan initialised before the field existed): record it now, before anything commits — read the format's authoring.md → Storage Pathspecs and copy the fenced array:

```bash
node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest set {work_unit}.planning.{topic} storage_paths '{format storage pathspecs}'
```

> *Output the next fenced block as a code block:*

```
Revisiting scoping for "{topic:(titlecase)}".

What should change in the spec or plan?
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

Apply the requested edits — the spec and `planning.md` directly, task file content per the format's **[authoring.md](../workflow-planning-process/references/output-formats/{format}/authoring.md)**. Hard rules still hold: maximum 2 tasks, no acceptance criteria. Then:

1. If the spec changed, re-index it (re-completion re-indexes over the same identity):
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs topic complete {work_unit} specification {topic}
   ```
2. Re-complete scoping:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs topic complete {work_unit} scoping {topic}
   ```
3. Commit — `--plan` stages the work unit, the project manifest, and the plan's declared storage in one scoped call (the knowledge store rides along automatically):
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs commit {work_unit} -m "scoping({work_unit}): adjust specification and plan" --plan {topic}
   ```

→ Proceed to **Step 8**.

#### If `restart`

1. Read the planning item once — `format`, `external_id`, and `storage_paths` all ride the subtree:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest get {work_unit}.planning.{topic}
   ```
2. Load the format's **[authoring.md](../workflow-planning-process/references/output-formats/{format}/authoring.md)**
3. Follow the authoring file's cleanup instructions to remove authored tasks for this topic — the cleanup targets the entity identified by `external_id`
4. Delete the spec and plan files: `rm -rf .workflows/{work_unit}/specification/{topic}/ .workflows/{work_unit}/planning/{topic}/`
5. Remove the spec's knowledge-base entry:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-knowledge/scripts/knowledge.cjs remove --work-unit {work_unit} --phase specification --topic {topic}
   ```
6. Delete the specification and planning manifest entries — the scoping item stays `in-progress`; the fresh run re-completes it at Write Tasks:
   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest delete {work_unit}.specification items.{topic}
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs manifest delete {work_unit}.planning items.{topic}
   ```
7. Commit with raw git — the planning item was just deleted, so `--plan` has nothing to read; stage the work unit, the knowledge store (only when `.workflows/.knowledge` exists — staging a nonexistent path is a git error), and the `storage_paths` read in step 1, then commit. Each entry passes as a bare pathspec; when the array is `[]` or the field is absent, stage nothing extra.
   ```bash
   git add -- .workflows/{work_unit} .workflows/.knowledge {storage_paths}
   git commit -m "scoping({work_unit}): restart scoping"
   ```

→ Proceed to **Step 1**.
