# workflow-gates

A Claude Code mod that draws the workflow engine's gates in the band above the
prompt instead of leaving the model to reproduce them.

The engine states each gate as data beside the menu it composed. This mod
announces itself at the session's start so the engine collects that data, arms
the gate off the Bash result that carried it, cuts the menu out of what the
model reads, and draws the rows where they stay put while the transcript
scrolls; while any screen but the terminal is attached, it leaves the menu as
text so every screen shows it, though a screen that attaches after a menu was
drawn on the terminal does not get that menu. No gate's prose names the mod;
only workflow-start's setup step does, which stops the session until the mod
is running in Claude Code's terminal app.

A click on a row puts its answer in the prompt box; a second click on it sends
it as the next message, which the workflows read as the answer. Once a click
has given the band the keyboard, the arrows move between rows, Enter or a row's
own key picks, and Enter on the picked row sends. A sent answer enters under
the plugin's name, framed for the model and labelled in the transcript as the
plugin's; the mod leaves what it sent in the conversation's own folder (see
below) as `sent.json`. A second plugin, `workflow-gates-rows`
(`../workflow-gates-rows/`), reads that record to draw the row as the question
and the answer, since no plugin can redraw the row of a prompt it submitted.
Typing answers too: a key and Enter at the prompt, or Esc then Enter after a
pick. Rows only typing can answer — Ask, Comment, a range — draw dim, and a
click on one says to type it in the prompt. The footer under the rows says
which: how to answer, what is in the prompt, or where to type.

The band is never taller than the rows Claude Code gives it, so it never
scrolls. A gate that fits shows whole: a rule, the statement and the question,
the rows, the footer. One that does not keeps its rule, question and footer in
place and shows its rows a page at a time, every page the same height, over a
line reading `↑ previous   ↓ next   page 1 of 3`; a click on either turns the
page and puts the cursor on its first row. The arrows carry the cursor across
pages, the page following it, and a row's own key picks that row whichever
page it is on.

A turn the person did not start — a background agent's report, a
notification, a schedule — leaves the band as it is, its rows live. The band
comes off when the person starts a turn or replies into a running one, or when
a turn draws a different gate over it. Esc on such a turn leaves the band as it
is, unless the turn had already rendered a different gate: the model now waits
at that gate's stop, so the band empties. A second click while Claude works
holds the answer instead of sending it: its row reads `· queued`, and the
footer says it sends when Claude finishes. A click on the queued row takes it
back to a pick, and a click on another row picks that one instead. As the turn
ends, the held answer sends if the same gate is still on the band; if the turn
rendered a different gate, the answer is dropped unsent, and the new gate's
footer says so; if Esc stopped the turn with the same gate still up, the
answer goes back into the prompt box as a pick. When a pick's gate goes, its
answer leaves the prompt box too, unless the person has edited it there.
Typing while Claude works joins Claude Code's own queue.

Esc on a turn an answer started or joined puts its gate back, dropping
whatever that turn drew, as long as no tool has run in it; once one has, the
band stays empty, since the mod cannot tell a read from a write. A `/clear`
takes the gate off the band.

At the end of every turn, and as the conversation ends, the mod keeps what the
band shows — the gate, or nothing — in the conversation's own folder,
`~/.config/workflows/conversations/{session-id}/gate.json` (under
`WORKFLOWS_CONFIG_DIR` where that is set, beside the workflows' system
config), found by the session id wherever the session's working directory has
moved, and stamped with where the transcript ends, not counting the lines
Claude Code writes around an interrupted turn. A conversation resumed with
`claude --resume` or `/resume`, or picked up again by a restart or a reload of
the mod's files, gets its gate back as long as its transcript still ends
there, with nothing picked or held — a held answer waits on a turn that does
not come back; one that moved on while the mod was not loaded gets nothing. A
session the mod was loaded into after it started carries no announcement, so
there it keeps and reads back nothing, and a conversation that does not run
the workflows has no folder and keeps nothing — nor does one in a process
that names neither a home directory nor `WORKFLOWS_CONFIG_DIR`. The folder
holds one gate, and goes once Claude Code has deleted the conversation's
transcript, so a kept gate lives as long as its conversation can be resumed,
with one exception: a conversation whose end the session-end hook never saw
keeps its folder — the session that first installed the hook, which Claude
Code picks up only as a session starts, or one that crashed.

The engine emits the menu regardless, so where the mod is off or absent the
model reads the text menu the engine wrote.

The mod is part of the workflows, and the first `/workflow-start` switches it
on wherever it can run: Claude Code's terminal app, from 2.1.282, with this
directory installed in the project. Claude Code takes
`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS` from the person's own settings, managed
settings or the shell, never from a project's settings, so there every
`/workflow-start` makes it `"1"` in the `env` of the person's Claude Code
settings — `settings.json` in `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` where that is set, else
`~/.claude/settings.json`. Claude Code reads its settings only when it starts,
so a start that writes it ends by asking for a restart, and the next session
loads the mod. In the terminal app the workflows run only with the mod: a
start that finds the flag there with the mod not running, that cannot read or
write that file, or that runs on a Claude Code older than 2.1.282 stops and
says why. Anywhere else — the web, an IDE extension, another entrypoint, a
project without this directory — nothing is written, and the workflows carry
on with the text menus.

Function hooks can be on where the mod cannot run — the flag in the person's
settings reaches every Claude Code app and version that reads them, and
anyone's own settings or shell can set it — so at the session's start the mod
applies the boot's rules: where `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` is other than `cli`,
`CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` is set, or the version the session reports is older than
2.1.282 or not a release's (a development build among them), it announces
nothing, so it draws, keeps and sets nothing — the menus stay text, and Claude
Code runs as it would without it.

## What it sets in Claude Code

Every session in Claude Code's terminal app, from 2.1.282, starts with Claude
Code's `SendUserMessage` tool switched on (`CLAUDE_CODE_PEWTER_OWL_TOOL=true`):
Claude Code builds its tool list just after the session starts, so that is
the only moment the switch counts. The mod keeps the tool behind ToolSearch
in every such session, one answer that never changes and so never spends the
prompt cache; a plain session's tool list is Claude Code's own.

In a conversation that runs the workflows there, the mod sets
`CLAUDE_CODE_THINKING_DISPLAY_UPDATES=false`, which stops one-line summaries of
Claude's thinking printing as if they were output, and
`CLAUDE_CODE_SILENT_TURN_REMINDER=false`, which stops the nudge to say what
Claude is doing; project settings cannot set the second. Claude Code reads
both per request. Every engine call marks the conversation that made it — a
`workflow` file in its folder, named by the session id Claude Code hands every
command — and the mod reads that mark by its own session id after each of the
conversation's Bash calls and when it starts, so a command that only mentions
the engine marks nothing. What the settings replace, the person's own value or
none, is kept in the process's environment (`WORKFLOWS_HARNESS_REPLACED`),
which a reload of the mod's files keeps, and a `/clear` or a resume puts it
back exactly. A marked conversation gets the workflow values back when the mod
next follows it, whether `claude --resume`, a restart or `/resume` in the same
process brings it back. A plain conversation in the same project keeps Claude
Code's defaults and the person's own settings: the mod never touches either
there.

## Working on it

    npm run mod:types       # fetch the API declarations into types/ (gitignored)
    npm run typecheck:mod   # tsc against those declarations
    npm run test:mod        # claude plugin test

The declarations come from the Claude Code repository and are regenerable, so
they are not committed. Fetch them before the first typecheck.

Function hooks are early access: Claude Code loads this mod only where they
are on — `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_FUNCTION_HOOKS=1` in the environment or in any
settings file but a project's, or switched on for the account — and the test
script sets the flag for itself.
