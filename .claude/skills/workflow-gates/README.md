# workflow-gates

A Claude Code mod that draws the workflow engine's gates in the band above the
prompt instead of leaving the model to reproduce them.

The engine states each gate as data beside the menu it composed. This mod
announces itself at the session's start so the engine collects that data, arms
the gate off the Bash result that carried it, cuts the menu out of what the
model reads, and draws the rows where they stay put while the transcript
scrolls; while any screen but the terminal or the Desktop app is attached
beside it, it leaves the menu as text so every screen shows it, though a
screen that attaches after a menu was drawn does not get that menu. No gate's
prose names the mod; only workflow-start's setup step does, with a notice when
the mod could run in Claude Code's terminal app or the Desktop app's Code tab
but is not running.

A click on a row puts its answer in the prompt box; a second click on it sends
it as the next message, which the workflows read as the answer. Once a click
has given the band the keyboard, the arrows move between rows, Enter or a row's
own key picks, and Enter on the picked row sends. A sent answer enters under
the plugin's name, framed for the model and labelled in the transcript as the
plugin's; the mod leaves what it sent in the conversation's own folder (see
below) as `sent.json`. A second plugin, `workflow-gates-rows`
(`../workflow-gates-rows/`), reads that record to draw the row as the question
and the answer, since no plugin can redraw the row of a prompt it submitted.
Typing answers too: a key and Enter at the prompt, or Esc then Enter after a
pick. Rows only typing can answer — Ask, Comment, a range — draw dim, and a
click on one says to type it in the prompt. The footer under the rows says
which: how to answer, what is in the prompt, or where to type.

The band is never taller than the rows Claude Code gives it, so it never
scrolls. A gate that fits shows whole: a rule, the statement and the question,
the rows, the footer. One that does not keeps its rule, question and footer in
place and shows its rows a page at a time, every page the same height, over a
line reading `↑ previous   ↓ next   page 1 of 3`; a click on either turns the
page and puts the cursor on its first row. The arrows carry the cursor across
pages, the page following it, and a row's own key picks that row whichever
page it is on.

A turn the person did not start — a background agent's report, a
notification, a schedule — leaves the band as it is, its rows live. The band
comes off when the person starts a turn or replies into a running one, or when
a turn draws a different gate over it. Esc on such a turn leaves the band as it
is, unless the turn had already rendered a different gate: the model now waits
at that gate's stop, so the band empties. A second click while Claude works
holds the answer instead of sending it: its row reads `· queued`, and the
footer says it sends when Claude finishes. A click on the queued row takes it
back to a pick, and a click on another row picks that one instead. As the turn
ends, the held answer sends if the same gate is still on the band; if the turn
rendered a different gate, the answer is dropped unsent, and the new gate's
footer says so; if Esc stopped the turn with the same gate still up, the
answer goes back into the prompt box as a pick. When a pick's gate goes, its
answer leaves the prompt box too, unless the person has edited it there.
Typing while Claude works joins Claude Code's own queue.

Esc on a turn an answer started or joined puts its gate back, dropping
whatever that turn drew, as long as no tool has run in it; once one has, the
band stays empty, since the mod cannot tell a read from a write. A `/clear`
takes the gate off the band.

At the end of every turn, and as the conversation ends, the mod keeps what the
band shows — the gate, or nothing — in the conversation's own folder,
`~/.config/workflows/conversations/{session-id}/gate.json` (under
`WORKFLOWS_CONFIG_DIR` where that is set, beside the workflows' system
config), found by the session id wherever the session's working directory has
moved, and stamped with where the transcript ends, not counting the lines
Claude Code writes around an interrupted turn. A conversation resumed with
`claude --resume` or `/resume`, or picked up again by a restart or a reload of
the mod's files, gets its gate back as long as its transcript still ends
there, with nothing picked or held — a held answer waits on a turn that does
not come back; one that moved on while the mod was not loaded gets nothing. A
session the mod was loaded into after it started carries no announcement, so
there it keeps and reads back nothing, and a conversation that does not run
the workflows has no folder and keeps nothing — nor does one in a process
that names neither a home directory nor `WORKFLOWS_CONFIG_DIR`. The folder
holds one gate, and goes once Claude Code has deleted the conversation's
transcript, so a kept gate lives as long as its conversation can be resumed,
with one exception: a conversation whose end the session-end hook never saw
keeps its folder — the session that first installed the hook, which Claude
Code picks up only as a session starts, or one that crashed.

The engine emits the menu regardless, so where the mod is off or absent the
model reads the text menu the engine wrote.

The mod is part of the workflows, and it runs in Claude Code's terminal app
and the Desktop app's Code tab, from 2.1.287, with this directory installed in
the project; mods are on by default there, so nothing switches it on. Claude
Code loads a plugin as a session starts, so a session already open when the
mod was installed or updated loads it in the next one. The mod is the
workflows' upgrade layer and the engine's text menus their floor: a
`/workflow-start` that finds the mod not running — a session started before
the mod was installed or updated, mods turned off by `--safe-mode`, `--bare`,
`"disableAllHooks": true` or an organization's policy, or installed mods
switched off remotely by Anthropic — says so and carries on with typed menus;
one that runs on a Claude Code older than 2.1.287 stops and says why. Anywhere
else — the web, the VS Code extension, a Desktop session that runs in the
cloud, another entrypoint, a project without this directory — the workflows
carry on with the text menus and say nothing.

The Desktop app runs the session as an SDK host: the session starts drawing
nowhere and the app attaches after, so the band reads the screens attached at
each Bash call that states a gate, and the person's own message there arrives
as the host's (an `sdk` origin), which the band reads as theirs.

Claude Code can load the mod where it does not run — another entrypoint, or an
older Claude Code with function hooks switched on — so at the session's start
the mod applies the boot's rules: where `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` is none of
`cli`, `claude-desktop` and `claude-desktop-3p`, `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` is set,
or the version the session reports is older than 2.1.287 or not a release's (a
development build among them), it announces nothing, so it draws, keeps and
sets nothing — the menus stay text, and Claude Code runs as it would without
it.

## Handoffs

The mod also carries the workflows' handoffs: every move into work, which the
engine names with `engine handoff`, starts in a cleared conversation. At the
session's start, where it announces the gate surface, the mod announces that
it carries handoffs too (`WORKFLOWS_HANDOFF=1`, a variable of its own, which
the engine reads apart from `WORKFLOWS_GATE_SURFACE`). The engine then answers
a handoff with a `HANDOFF` payload beside the line naming where the work goes:
the continuation to send (``Invoke `/<skill> <args>`.``) and that line. The
payload on a Bash result of the conversation's own call — never a subagent's —
arms the handoff, and every call has it cut from what the model reads; the
line and the skill stay. As the turn ends the mod clears the conversation and,
in the conversation that follows, leaves what it sends with the line as
`sent.json` in that conversation's folder, then sends the continuation, which
Claude acts on there, and shows a toast naming where the work went
(`Handed off → Planning · auth-flow`). The clear runs from a timer started at
the turn's end, whatever else there fails: a mod cannot run a command inside a
hook the turn waits on. A send that is dropped or fails goes into the prompt
box for Enter instead; where the box will not take it either, the toast holds
the continuation for the person to send, and stays longer. A clear that fails
sends in place, so the work still goes on. Esc on the turn that handed off
carries nothing: Esc means stop. `workflow-gates-rows` draws the continuation's
transcript row as the line. Where the mod does not announce, the engine says so
and the workflows invoke the skill in the same conversation.

## What it sets in Claude Code

Every session in either app, from 2.1.287, starts with Claude Code's
`SendUserMessage` tool switched on (`CLAUDE_CODE_PEWTER_OWL_TOOL=true`):
Claude Code builds its tool list just after the session starts, so that is the
only moment the switch counts. The mod keeps the tool behind ToolSearch in
every such session, one answer that never changes and so never spends the
prompt cache; a plain session's tool list is Claude Code's own.

In a conversation that runs the workflows there, the mod sets
`CLAUDE_CODE_THINKING_DISPLAY_UPDATES=false`, which stops one-line summaries of
Claude's thinking printing as if they were output, and
`CLAUDE_CODE_SILENT_TURN_REMINDER=false`, which stops the nudge to say what
Claude is doing; project settings cannot set the second. Claude Code reads
both per request. Every engine call marks the conversation that made it — a
`workflow` file in its folder, named by the session id Claude Code hands every
command — and the mod reads that mark by its own session id after each of the
conversation's Bash calls and when it starts, so a command that only mentions
the engine marks nothing. What the settings replace, the person's own value or
none, is kept in the process's environment (`WORKFLOWS_HARNESS_REPLACED`),
which a reload of the mod's files keeps, and a `/clear` or a resume puts it
back exactly — except the clear a handoff runs, which leads into a workflow
conversation by construction and so leaves the workflow values on, the
person's own put back as that conversation ends. A marked conversation gets
the workflow values back when the mod next follows it, whether
`claude --resume`, a restart or `/resume` in the same process brings it back.
A plain conversation in the same project keeps Claude Code's defaults and the
person's own settings: the mod never touches either there.

## Working on it

    npm run mod:types       # fetch the API declarations into types/ (gitignored)
    npm run typecheck:mod   # tsc against those declarations
    npm run test:mod        # claude plugin test

The declarations come from the Claude Code repository and are regenerable, so
they are not committed. Fetch them before the first typecheck.

The suites run on Claude Code 2.1.287 or newer, where mods are on by
default.
