# Specification: CLI Verb Surface Redesign

## Specification

## Overview

Portal's CLI is redesigned in one intentional pass. Today's surface grew by accretion into overlapping, blurry session verbs (`open`, `attach`, `spawn`) with illegible input domains — the trigger being that even the author can't cleanly recall the difference between `open` and `attach`. This redesign audits the **full** command list (session verbs, utilities, and internal plumbing) against a single governing principle and two axioms.

### Governing principle: split the public surface by outcome, not by input shape

The public surface names *what happens*, not *what the argument looks like*. Input domains (session name, path, alias, zoxide query) are unified inside `open`'s resolution rather than made legible by choosing a different verb. Exactness (no-guessing) is demoted from a public verb to documented flags and hidden plumbing.

Concretely, this collapses today's three public session verbs into a single public verb, `open`. `open` keeps its name on semantic grounds — the portal metaphor ("you are opening a portal to a session") is the tool's founding play on words; the argument changes only how the destination is derived, not what the verb does. The name was kept explicitly **not** on migration-cost grounds.

### The two axioms

**Axiom 1 — absorb / net-N.** `open` opens N portals to N targets; the invoking terminal is one of those N surfaces. This is continuous in N: at N=1 the terminal is the only surface (open-here); at N>1 the terminal becomes one surface and N−1 host-terminal windows are spawned. There is no behavior cliff between single-target and multi-target — the "stay put while multi-opening" behavior is a deferred future flag, not the default.

**Axiom 2 — attach-vs-mint dichotomy.** A resolved target is one of two kinds:
- **Session-domain hit** (exact session name, session glob) → **attach** to that existing session.
- **Directory-domain hit** (path, alias, zoxide query) → **mint a brand-new session** at that directory, always.

There is no find-or-create. Directory targets always create a fresh `{project}-{nanoid}` session even when sessions already exist for that project (multiple sessions per project is the designed workflow). The precedence chain is therefore semantic — "surface an existing session, or open a new portal to a place" — not mere disambiguation.

### Porcelain / plumbing split

Truly-internal entry points stay invocable but hidden rather than public: the `--ack` receipt flag on `open`, and the entire `state` namespace (argv-invoked by tmux hooks and the saver pane). Everything a human is meant to type is public and documented.

### Scope of the redesign

In scope: the public verb surface and tiering (public / hidden), command names, shapes, and the back-compat posture. Out of scope: internal package/component/marker names (`internal/spawn`, the `spawn` log component, `@portal-spawn-*` markers) — these are unaffected by the redesign.
