SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All spec decision points verified: two-page architecture with bubbles/list, modal overlay system (kill, rename, delete, edit), command-pending mode with locked navigation and correct help bar, progressive Esc behavior, inside-tmux session exclusion with title display, default page evaluation, initial filter application to correct page, n-key CWD session creation, file browser sub-view integration, and undocumented x toggle. Help bar keybindings match spec exactly for all three modes (sessions, projects, command-pending). Old ProjectPickerModel deleted as specified. golang-pro MUST DO rules satisfied: exported types/functions documented, errors handled explicitly, table-driven tests with subtests used throughout, interfaces are small and focused. code-quality.md principles followed: dependency injection via functional options, no deep nesting, concrete types used for data passing.
