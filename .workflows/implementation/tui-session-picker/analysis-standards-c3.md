FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: Implementation conforms to specification and project conventions. All previous cycle findings (status line position, quit help binding) have been addressed. The two-page architecture, modal system, command-pending mode lockout, progressive Esc behavior, inside-tmux session exclusion, default page selection, initial filter application, and all help bar layouts match the spec. The old ProjectPickerModel has been removed as specified. Interfaces are small and focused per golang-pro MUST DO rules, error handling is explicit, and tests use table-driven patterns with subtests.
