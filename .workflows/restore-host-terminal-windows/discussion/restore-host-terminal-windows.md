# Discussion: Restore Host Terminal Windows

## Context

Portal's resurrection layer restores the **tmux/server layer** after reboot (sessions/windows/panes rebuild on attach), but not the **host-local terminal layer** — the actual terminal-emulator windows that fronted those sessions. After a crash with ~32 sessions, ~28 reattached at the server level, but the user still rebuilt every macOS terminal window by hand (~14 Spaces, one project zone per Space) — roughly an hour of manual work.

This feature lets the user reopen N sessions, each springing into its own host terminal surface, via a **multi-select** in the Portal picker. Research closed the feasibility questions and locked a set of foundational decisions; this discussion resolves the **live design and operational decisions** that remain.

### Foundation already settled in research (not re-litigated here unless reopened)

- **MVP shape:** a Sessions-page **multi-select mode** (proposed `M`) → select sessions → `Enter` → each springs open in its own host window, attached. Implemented as a *general selection mode* with spawn as its first action (future bulk ops can reuse it).
- **Windows-only v1:** window-vs-tab fidelity dropped → removes the entire introspection requirement.
- **Spawn command:** the N−1 new windows each run **`portal attach <session>`** (existing chokepoint connector); the **trigger window is reused** as one session via `switch-client`. Net window count = **N, not N+1** (no leftover empty picker window — a hard anti-requirement).
- **Cross-terminal:** Ghostty-first; **dual configurability** (built-in Go adapters + user-config override/escape hatch), shipped in v1. Precedence: **config override → native adapter → unsupported**.
- **Identity (feasibility-validated live):** detect the host terminal via **client-PID → process-tree walk → macOS bundle id**, matched as a **family** (e.g. `dev.warp.Warp-*`), with a **friendly alias** (`ghostty`) as the user-facing key. Client resolved by **highest `client_activity`** (`focused` is unreliable). Remote/mosh clients → NULL bundle id → honest no-op.
- **Unsupported-terminal UX:** info **banner** (not modal) naming the detected identity.
- **Duplicate-surface guard:** none — opening an already-attached session is a fine no-op (tmux synchronises both).
- **Scope yardstick:** MVP is "collapse the attaching into one action per batch" — a **partial win** the user explicitly accepts. Remember-the-grouping + macOS Spaces placement are deferred follow-ons (Spaces already parked in inbox).

## 1. Spawn-Execution Architecture

### Context

Research (review-F6) framed this as "where spawn executes architecturally": picker action shelling out from the TUI process vs a new `portal` subcommand vs both — flagged as coupled to identity detection because it determines which process's env feeds detect-self, how the attach line is assembled, and whether a headless/scriptable reopen is possible. It's the keystone: settling it shapes the config schema, test seam, and daemon footprint.

### The constraint that narrows the space

The decision is tighter than F6 implies. The **no-leftover-window** anti-requirement (net N windows, never N+1) forces the picker to **own its own window reuse**: it turns its own host window into one session via `switch-client` (inside tmux) or exec-`tmux attach` (outside tmux), which *replaces the picker process* so the window becomes a session rather than falling back to an empty shell. Therefore the picker always self-attaches to one of the N; only the **N−1 others** are externally spawned, and each just runs the **existing `portal attach <session>`**. So "where spawn runs" reduces to: *where does the detect-terminal + spawn-the-N−1 logic live?*

### Options Considered

**Option A — inline in the TUI.** The Bubble Tea process, on `Enter`, detects the host terminal and fires the spawns itself, then self-attaches.
- Cons: spawn logic buried in the update loop is hard to unit-test; capability locked inside the TUI (no headless/scriptable reuse); no clean DI seam.

**Option B — shared internal package + `portal reopen` subcommand (chosen).** Detection + adapter resolution + spawn live in an internal package; `portal reopen <sessions…>` is a thin CLI over it; the picker calls the **same package in-process** for the N−1, then self-attaches.
- Pros: argv→effects boundary is unit-testable with a faked `Adapter` (command construction, detect-self resolution, precedence); `portal reopen` becomes a first-class headless command the deferred "remember-and-restore workspace" + Spaces follow-ons can reuse; matches the project's DI pattern.
- Cons: slightly more surface than A (a new subcommand + package).

### Journey

Started from F6's three-way framing (picker vs subcommand vs both). Realised the "both" tension mostly dissolves once you see the picker *must* keep ownership of its own window reuse (the anti-leftover rule), so the subcommand can never own the whole flow — it owns the N−1 spawns, the picker owns its self-attach. That reframes A-vs-B as purely "where does the reusable spawn logic live," which testability + the explicitly-deferred workspace-restore feature settle decisively for B.

Considered detection placement as a complication (does the subcommand vs TUI change what env detect-self sees?) and concluded it doesn't fight the choice: detection's backbone is the process-tree walk (`list-clients` → client PID by highest `client_activity` → walk to terminal bundle id), a library call both callers can make; env vars are only an optional fast-path. Detection anchors on the **triggering picker process** — outside tmux it walks its *own* tree to the terminal; inside tmux it hops via `list-clients` to the host client and walks that (one extra hop, same destination). Full identity resolution is subtopic #7.

Walked the concrete 3-session flow to confirm the model: (1) detect terminal → (2) one `osascript` call per N−1 window, each carrying `portal attach <session>` as its startup command → (3) exec self into the last session. **Order is load-bearing**: step 3 is a point of no return (exec replaces the picker), so the N−1 spawns must complete first. One spawn call per window (not one combined script) for failure isolation.

In-process vs subprocess for the picker→reopen call: chose **in-process** so spawn errors surface back into the TUI where the user is looking; the `portal reopen` subprocess remains the headless/test front door. Both the "in-process vs subprocess" detail and "does the picker wait to confirm the N−1 spawned before it execs into the Nth?" are **coupled to #3** (partial-failure contract) — left open there.

### Decision

**Option B.** Build a shared internal reopen package (detection + adapter resolution + spawn), exposed two ways: called **in-process by the picker** for the N−1 spawns, and as a **`portal reopen <sessions…>` subcommand** for headless/scriptable/test use. Each spawned window runs the existing `portal attach <session>`; `portal reopen` is *not* what runs in the new windows. The picker self-attaches to the remaining session via its existing connector, reusing its own window (anti-leftover). Confidence: high.

- **Mental model:** one service, two callers — like a Laravel Service class reached from both an Artisan command and an HTTP controller.
- **Coupled-out:** in-process-vs-subprocess + wait-for-spawn-confirmation → #3; full terminal-identity detection → #7.
- **Impl flag (review-002 F3, for spec):** spawned windows run `portal attach` as their startup command, so `portal`/`tmux` must be on `PATH` in Ghostty's launch context (not guaranteed a login shell).
- **Bootstrap cost → external dependency (review-001 F1).** `attach` is not in `skipTmuxCheck`, so each spawned `portal attach` re-runs the full 11-step bootstrap orchestrator — a 14-window burst would fire 13 near-simultaneous full bootstraps against one server (a distinct concern from #11's tmux-attach race). We rejected the two workarounds (a hidden `--skip-bootstrap` flag; an internal bootstrap-exempt `portal state attach`-style command) — the latch belongs in bootstrap, not in a parallel attach path, and the awkward command name was the tell. Resolved by a **separate `warm-command-bootstrap-latch` feature** (logged to inbox `2026-06-30--warm-command-bootstrap-latch`): a once-per-server-lifetime tmux server-option latch (`@portal-bootstrapped`) set at end of bootstrap, so warm commands fast-skip the 11 steps. **This feature depends on that landing first**; reopen then spawns *plain* `portal attach` with no special-casing. This largely **subsumes #11** (attach contention).

## 3. Burst & Partial-Failure Contract

### Context

The motivating scenario is a *large* burst (rebuild ~14 windows post-crash), not the clean 3-window path. This subtopic owns the contract for when a burst does **not** fully complete: a spawn/attach fails, or the user aborts mid-burst.

### Journey (in progress)

- **Bootstrap-per-window reframe (review-001 F1) — resolved out of #3.** The "burst = N concurrent full bootstraps" angle is dissolved by the separate warm-command bootstrap-latch dependency (see #1's dependency note), leaving the burst as N cheap attaches. So #3 narrows back to genuine *spawn/attach* partial failure, not bootstrap contention.
- **Still open:** the core partial-failure contract (all-or-nothing vs best-effort-with-report); and **user cancellation/interrupt mid-burst (review-001 F4)** — step 3 (self-exec into the Nth session) is a point of no return, so there's a live window where the picker has spawned K of N−1 and could catch an interrupt.

## Summary

### Key Insights

*(captured as the discussion progresses)*

### Open Threads

*(captured as the discussion progresses)*

### Current State

- Research foundation settled (see Context); 12 live subtopics seeded.
- **#1 Spawn-Execution Architecture — decided** (Option B: shared reopen package + `portal reopen` subcommand, picker calls in-process; N−1 spawned, picker self-reuses for the Nth).
- **#3 Burst & Partial-Failure — exploring.** Bootstrap-per-window (review-001 F1) resolved out via an external dependency; core partial-failure contract + cancellation (F4) still open.
- Open coupling threads: #3 (partial-failure / in-process-vs-subprocess / wait-for-spawn), #7 (terminal-identity detection).

### Open Threads

- **External dependency:** reopen depends on the `warm-command-bootstrap-latch` feature (inbox `2026-06-30--warm-command-bootstrap-latch`) landing first. The user will **not spec reopen until warm-command-bootstrap is done**; discussion proceeds assuming warm attaches are cheap by implementation time.
- Outstanding review-001 findings to surface at their subtopics: F2 (headless `portal reopen` has no terminal to detect → #1/#7), F3 (spawned attach binds to PATH `portal`, version skew → #1/#7), F5 (reopen observability/log component → likely new subtopic), F6 (N=0/N=1 boundary of self-attach-last → #3), F7 (detect-self as standalone query / package shape → #7/#8).
