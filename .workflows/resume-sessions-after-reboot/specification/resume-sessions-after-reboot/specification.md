# Specification: Resume Sessions After Reboot

## Specification

### Overview

Portal manages tmux sessions. After a system reboot, tmux-resurrect restores session layout, CWDs, and pane structure — but processes are dead. Portal provides a generic hook system that can resume processes (Claude Code, dev servers, etc.) in their original panes.

The core problem: tmux-resurrect's `@resurrect-processes` re-runs original launch commands, which doesn't work for tools where the resume command differs from the launch command (e.g., `claude --resume <uuid>` vs `claude`).

**Architecture:**

- **Persistent registry** (file on disk): maps pane IDs to restart commands — survives reboot
- **Volatile markers** (tmux server options): indicate a process was registered on this server lifetime — die with the server
- **Execution trigger**: Portal's connection flow (`portal open`) — lazy, not eager
- **Execution condition**: persistent entry exists AND volatile marker absent (server restarted since registration)

External tools register hooks via `xctl hooks set` (e.g., Claude Code's `SessionStart` hook calls `xctl hooks set --on-resume "claude --resume $SESSION_ID"`). Portal handles pane mapping internally using `$TMUX_PANE`.

### Registry Model & Storage

**Scoping model:** Per-pane, flat registry. A simple `pane_id → restart_command` map. No session or window hierarchy stored — when Portal needs to act on a session's processes, it queries tmux for that session's panes and cross-references the registry.

Pane IDs (`%0`, `%1`, etc.) are globally unique across the entire tmux server, assigned sequentially, and persist across tmux-resurrect.

**Storage format:** JSON at `~/.config/portal/hooks.json`.

```json
{
  "%3": { "on-resume": "claude --resume abc123" },
  "%7": { "on-resume": "claude --resume def456" }
}
```

- Follows existing convention: structured data → JSON, simple key-value → flat file
- Hooks are structured (pane × event type) and will grow to support multiple events per pane
- Reuses the atomic write pattern from `project/store.go`

### CLI Surface

`xctl hooks` with `set`/`rm`/`list` subcommands:

```
xctl hooks set --on-resume "claude --resume $SESSION_ID"
xctl hooks rm --on-resume
xctl hooks list
```

**Behavior:**

- Pane ID inferred from `$TMUX_PANE` — caller doesn't need to pass it
- `set` is idempotent — re-registering overwrites the previous command for that pane and event type
- Only `--on-resume` implemented initially; surface supports future event types (e.g., `--on-start`, `--on-close`)
- Mirrors `xctl alias set`/`rm`/`list` for consistency

**`hooks list`** shows all registered hooks across all panes — no filtering flags needed.

Under the hood: `xctl hooks set` = `portal hooks set`.

### Volatile Marker Mechanism

Use the tmux server itself as volatile storage. Set a tmux server-level option when registering a hook — this marker lives only in server memory and dies when the server dies. tmux-resurrect does NOT restore tmux options.

**Implementation:**

- **On register (`hooks set`):** Set tmux server option `@portal-active-{pane_id}` (e.g., `set-option -s @portal-active-%3 1`)
- **On deregister (`hooks rm`):** Remove tmux server option `@portal-active-{pane_id}`
- **On execution check:** Query for the marker — absent means server restarted since registration

**Why this works:**

- `set-option -s @custom-var` works — tmux supports `@`-prefixed user options at server level
- tmux-resurrect does not save or restore any tmux options (server, session, window, or pane level)
- `set-environment -g` also dies with the server and isn't restored
- The marker's absence is a tautological indicator of "server restarted since registration"
