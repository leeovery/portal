# Discussion: Resume Sessions After Reboot

## Context

Portal manages tmux sessions. After a system reboot, tmux-resurrect restores session layout, CWDs, and pane structure — but processes are dead. The idea is a generic restart command registry so Portal can resume processes (Claude Code, dev servers, etc.) in their original panes.

The core problem: tmux-resurrect's `@resurrect-processes` re-runs original launch commands, which doesn't work for tools like Claude Code where the resume command differs from the launch command (`claude --resume <uuid>` vs `claude`).

### Key Research Findings

- Claude Code's `SessionStart` hook provides `session_id` (the UUID needed for resume) and fires on every session start/resume
- `$TMUX_PANE` is available in every tmux process, so Portal can discover pane association without explicit passing
- Tmux pane IDs (e.g. `%0`, `%1`) persist across resurrect
- A hook script stays tool-specific — it only knows about Claude's session ID; Portal handles pane mapping internally

## What scoping model should the registry use?

### Context

A tmux server runs multiple sessions, each with windows (tabs), each with panes (splits). A single project session might have 4 Claude instances across 4 panes. The registry needs to map restart commands to the right target.

### Options Considered

**Per-pane (flat map: pane_id → command)**
- Pane IDs (`%0`, `%1`, etc.) are globally unique across the entire tmux server
- Assigned sequentially by the server, not scoped to session or window
- Persist across tmux-resurrect
- No need to model session/window hierarchy — tmux already knows which panes belong to which session

**Per-session or per-window**
- Can't handle multiple processes per session/window without becoming "list of per-pane commands" anyway
- Adds hierarchy to the registry that tmux already provides

### Decision

**Per-pane, flat registry.** A simple `pane_id → restart_command` map. No session or window hierarchy stored — when Portal needs to act on a session's processes, it queries tmux for that session's panes and cross-references the registry. This is the simplest model that handles all cases.

## When should restart commands execute?

### Context

After reboot and resurrect, registered commands need to fire at some point. The question is whether to restart everything immediately or wait until the user actually needs a session.

### Options Considered

**Eager (on server bootstrap)**
- Everything warm by the time you interact
- But could fire up 6+ Claude instances across projects you won't touch today
- Resource-heavy for no benefit on unused sessions

**Lazy (on session select/attach via Portal)**
- Only restarts what you actually use
- Portal already mediates session selection — natural trigger point
- Small delay on attach while processes spin up

**Hybrid**
- Priority system for some eager, some lazy
- Added complexity for unclear benefit

### Journey

Eager was quickly ruled out — spinning up heavy processes across all sessions on boot is wasteful. Lazy fits naturally because Portal already has the moment where the user selects a session (`portal open`). That's the trigger.

Key clarification: this is a Portal-mediated action, not a tmux hook. If someone uses raw `tmux attach`, they've bypassed Portal and don't get Portal's benefits. Portal doesn't try to hook in backwards. Clean boundary — Portal owns the registry, Portal triggers the restarts.

### Decision

**Lazy execution, triggered during Portal's connection flow.** Restart commands fire when the user connects to a session via Portal (e.g. `portal open`). No eager startup, no tmux-level hooks. Bypass Portal, bypass the registry.

## Should Portal detect dead processes or just execute whatever is registered?

### Context

After reboot, panes have dead processes (empty shells). But in normal operation, a pane might still have its process running. Portal needs to know when to fire a restart command and when to skip.

### Journey

Initially considered two simple approaches: registry-driven (just execute if entry exists) or detection-first (check if process is dead). Both had problems — registry-driven would re-execute on normal reattach; detection couldn't distinguish "user quit Claude" from "reboot killed Claude."

The real problem is distinguishing "server restarted" from "same server, process just stopped." An "executed" flag was proposed but had a flaw: if the user manually exits Claude without the exit hook firing, the flag would be unset, causing a false restart on next attach.

Server PID/timestamp tracking was explored — record which server lifetime the entry was registered under, compare on attach. Felt brittle and overcomplicated.

The breakthrough: **use the tmux server itself as volatile storage.** Set a tmux server-level option (`set-option -s @portal-active-{pane_id}`) when registering. This marker lives only in server memory — it dies when the server dies and resurrect does NOT restore it.

Verified via research:
- `set-option -s @custom-var` works — tmux supports `@`-prefixed user options at server level
- tmux-resurrect does not save or restore any tmux options (server, session, window, or pane level)
- `set-environment -g` also dies with the server and isn't restored

### Decision

**Two-condition check: persistent entry exists AND volatile marker absent.**

- **Persistent store** (file on disk): `pane_id → restart_command` — survives reboot
- **Volatile marker** (tmux server option): `@portal-active-{pane_id}` — dies with server
- **On register**: write persistent entry + set volatile marker
- **On deregister**: remove persistent entry + remove volatile marker
- **Execute when**: entry exists AND marker absent

No process detection needed. No executed flags. No server PID tracking.

| Scenario | Entry? | Marker? | Result |
|----------|:---:|:---:|--------|
| Reboot, tool was running | Yes | No (server died) | Execute |
| Normal reattach, tool running | Yes | Yes | Skip |
| Reattach after clean exit | No (deregistered) | No (removed) | Skip |
| Reattach after crash/kill -9 | Yes | Yes (same server) | Skip |
| Reboot after clean exit | No | No | Skip |
| Reboot after crash (no deregister) | Yes | No (server died) | Execute |

Row 6 (crash then reboot) is arguably correct — tool was running, didn't signal intentional shutdown, server restarted. User can close it again if unwanted.

---

## Should Portal confirm before sending commands to panes, or auto-execute?

### Decision

**Auto-execute.** The entire point is restoring state to what it was before reboot. Confirmation would defeat the purpose — the user already registered these commands as "restart me." The two-condition check (entry + no marker) provides sufficient safety. If something restarts that shouldn't have, the user can close it.

---

## What should the subcommand be called and what's the CLI surface?

### Context

Portal needs a CLI surface for external tools to register and deregister restart commands. This should sit under `xctl` (the control plane). The naming should be general enough to support future lifecycle hooks beyond just resume.

### Options Considered

**`xctl resume register` / `xctl resume deregister`**
- Purpose-built for the resume use case
- Doesn't generalize to other hook types

**`xctl pane on-resume "cmd"` / `xctl pane hooks`**
- Pane-centric namespace
- Reads naturally but mixes concerns — pane management + hooks

**`xctl hooks set --on-resume "cmd"` / `xctl hooks rm --on-resume` / `xctl hooks list`**
- General hook system namespace
- `set`/`rm` mirrors existing `xctl alias set`/`rm` pattern — consistent surface
- `--on-resume` flag extends naturally to `--on-start`, `--on-close` without redesign
- One hook per event per pane — `set` is the right verb (idempotent overwrite)

### Journey

Started with single-purpose naming (`resume register`). Then explored whether this should be a more general hook system for pane lifecycle events (resume, start, end, open, close). Not building all events now, but the CLI surface should accommodate them.

Tried `xctl pane hook` — but three commands plus a flag plus a parameter felt verbose. Moved hooks to a top-level `xctl` namespace since they're the primary concept, not a sub-feature of "pane."

`set`/`rm`/`list` mirrors the existing `xctl alias` surface, giving `xctl` a consistent feel: both alias and hooks use the same verb pattern.

### Decision

**`xctl hooks` with `set`/`rm`/`list` subcommands:**

```
xctl hooks set --on-resume "claude --resume $SESSION_ID"
xctl hooks rm --on-resume
xctl hooks list
```

- Pane ID inferred from `$TMUX_PANE` — caller doesn't need to pass it
- `set` is idempotent — re-registering overwrites the previous command
- Only `--on-resume` implemented initially; surface supports future event types
- Mirrors `xctl alias set`/`rm`/`list` for consistency

Under the hood: `xctl hooks set` = `portal hooks set`.

`hooks list` shows all registered hooks across all panes — no filtering flags needed.

---

## What storage format and location for the registry?

### Context

Portal stores data in `~/.config/portal/`. Existing patterns: `projects.json` (JSON, structured) and `aliases` (flat key=value, simple mappings). Hooks need a home.

### Options Considered

**JSON file (`~/.config/portal/hooks.json`)**
```json
{
  "%3": { "on-resume": "claude --resume abc123" },
  "%7": { "on-resume": "claude --resume def456" }
}
```
- Handles nested structure naturally (pane → event → command)
- Consistent with `projects.json` for structured data
- Atomic write pattern already established in project store
- Extends cleanly to multiple hooks per pane

**Flat file (`~/.config/portal/hooks`)**
```
%3 on-resume claude --resume abc123
%7 on-resume claude --resume def456
```
- Consistent with `aliases`
- But two-level key makes parsing clunky
- Multiple hooks per pane in future would be awkward

### Decision

**JSON at `~/.config/portal/hooks.json`.** Follows the existing convention: structured data → JSON, simple key-value → flat file. Hooks are structured (pane × event type) and will grow to support multiple events per pane. Reuse the atomic write pattern from `project/store.go`.

## How should stale registrations be handled?

### Context

Over time, `hooks.json` could accumulate entries for panes that no longer exist (pane closed, session killed, etc.). These are harmless but wasteful.

### Decision

**Lazy cleanup on read, plus `xctl clean`.**

When Portal reads hooks (during `portal open`), cross-reference pane IDs against live tmux panes. Prune entries for panes that don't exist. Invisible to the user.

This mirrors the existing pattern: the TUI already calls `CleanStale()` on the project store every time it loads, automatically pruning projects whose directories no longer exist. The `clean` command provides the same capability explicitly but the real work happens lazily.

Adding hook cleanup to `xctl clean` is a natural fit — it already says "remove stale projects whose directories no longer exist." Extending to "remove hook entries for panes that no longer exist" is semantically identical.

---

## Should Portal warn about or prevent conflicts with `@resurrect-processes`?

### Decision

**No. Out of scope.** Portal has no awareness of tmux-resurrect or any other plugin. It doesn't know or care what's in the user's tmux config. If there's a conflict, that's the user's configuration to manage.
