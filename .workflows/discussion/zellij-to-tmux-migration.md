# Discussion: Migrating from Zellij to tmux

## Context

ZW (Zellij Workspaces) has a concluded specification built around Zellij as the terminal multiplexer. The user has decided to switch to tmux. The core UX design, project memory, TUI architecture, CLI structure, and distribution approach are all multiplexer-agnostic and carry forward. The Zellij-specific integration layer needs reworking.

This discussion identifies what changes, what stays, and resolves the tmux-specific design decisions before revising the specification.

## What are the tmux equivalents for all Zellij session operations?

### Context

The current spec references Zellij CLI commands throughout. Need verified tmux 3.6a equivalents.

### Decision

Verified against `man tmux` on the target system (tmux 3.6a):

| Operation | Zellij | tmux (verified) |
|---|---|---|
| Create or attach | `zellij attach -c <name>` | `tmux new-session -A -s <name>` (alias: `new`) |
| Create w/ start dir | cd + create | `tmux new-session -A -s <name> -c <dir>` |
| Attach to existing | `zellij attach <name>` | `tmux attach-session -t <name>` (alias: `attach`) |
| List sessions | `zellij list-sessions` | `tmux list-sessions` (alias: `ls`) |
| Kill session | `zellij kill-session <name>` | `tmux kill-session -t <name>` |
| Delete exited session | `zellij delete-session <name>` | N/A — tmux sessions don't persist after exit |
| Check session exists | N/A | `tmux has-session -t <name>` (alias: `has`) — exit 0/1 |
| Query tab/window names | `zellij --session <name> action query-tab-names` | `tmux list-windows -t <name>` (alias: `lsw`) |
| Rename session | `zellij action rename-session <new>` (inside only) | `tmux rename-session -t <name> <new>` (alias: `rename`) — works from outside |

**Key differences from Zellij:**
- tmux `new-session -A` combines create-or-attach in one command
- tmux supports `-c <dir>` to set the working directory at creation — no need to `cd` first
- tmux `rename-session` works from outside the session (Zellij could only rename from inside)
- tmux `has-session` provides a clean existence check (useful for argument resolution)
- tmux `list-sessions` output is structured, no ANSI codes to strip

**Directory change for new sessions**: The spec's current model (cd to dir, then create) simplifies to just passing `-c <resolved-dir>` on `new-session`. No directory change needed in ZW's process. Git root resolution still applies — resolve first, then pass to `-c`.

## What happens to exited/resurrectable sessions?

### Context

The Zellij spec had an "EXITED" section in the TUI showing dead-but-resurrectable sessions. Zellij natively persists session state after exit and allows individual session resurrection. tmux doesn't — sessions are alive or gone.

### Journey

Initially explored whether tmux-resurrect (installed on target system with tmux-continuum auto-saving every 10 min) could fill this gap. Research found:

- Resurrect stores snapshots at `~/.local/share/tmux/resurrect/` as tab-delimited text files
- The `last` symlink points to the most recent save
- Files contain session names, window info, working directories, running commands
- Detection is possible via directory existence or `tmux list-keys | grep resurrect`

However, resurrect's restore is **all-or-nothing** — it restores the entire saved state, not individual sessions. This is fundamentally different from Zellij's model where exited sessions are individually addressable objects.

**Key realisation**: Resurrect is disaster recovery (machine crash, tmux server dies), not a session management workflow. Users don't interact with dead sessions — they either have running sessions or they don't. The "exited sessions" concept was a Zellij-specific feature that doesn't map to tmux's model.

### Decision

**Drop the EXITED section entirely.**

- TUI shows only running sessions + new session option
- No resurrect integration — it's outside ZW's scope
- `zw clean` simplifies to only cleaning stale projects (directories that no longer exist on disk) — no "delete exited sessions" operation
- `zellij delete-session` has no tmux equivalent and is removed from the command mapping

## How should the layout system work with tmux?

### Context

The Zellij spec included a layout picker during new session creation — users could choose from `.kdl` layout files. tmux has no equivalent single-file layout format.

### Options Considered

**A. Drop layout selection entirely** — always create single-window sessions. Users split/arrange after attaching. Simplest path.

**B. tmux built-in layout strings** — `even-horizontal`, `main-vertical`, etc. Limited to pane arrangements, no commands per pane.

**C. Shell scripts as layouts** — small scripts that create windows/panes. How tmuxinator/smug work conceptually. Flexible but adds complexity.

**D. Structured layout config** — YAML/TOML files defining windows and panes. Essentially reimplementing tmuxinator inside ZW.

### Decision

**A — Drop layouts completely.** Not "defer to later" — not needed.

The core use case is SSH from phone → pick session → get working. Fastest path to a session is the most valuable thing. Layout selection was already optional in the Zellij spec (skipped when no custom layouts existed).

This simplifies the new session flow significantly. When starting a session in a saved project with no other prompts needed, session creation is immediate — no layout picker step.

**Spec impact:**
- Remove Layout Discovery section
- Remove layout picker from new session flow
- Remove `--layout` flag from session creation command
- New session flow for saved projects becomes: select project → session created immediately

## Should the tool be renamed?

### Context

"ZW" stands for "Zellij Workspaces" — no longer fits after switching to tmux.

### Options Considered

**tmux-flavoured (2 chars):**
- `tx` — "tmux execute/extend". Clear tmux connection, no known CLI conflicts.
- `tw` — "tmux workspaces". Direct successor to "zw". Keys on different rows.
- `tm` — "tmux manager". Could be confused with Time Machine on macOS.

**z-prefix (familiar territory):**
- `zx` — Already appeared in project history. Adjacent bottom-row keys, fast. Google has an npm `zx` tool but it's a Node package — no real conflict.
- `zz` — Same key twice, fastest possible. No CLI conflicts. But no semantic meaning, and `zz` is a vim motion.

**Other:**
- `mux` — 3 chars but immediately clear. "I'm a multiplexer tool." Distinctive, no conflicts.
- `sx` — "session execute". Short but anonymous.

### Journey

User wanted something that acknowledges tmux without hiding it. Considered keyboard ergonomics — already has `cx` for Claude Code, `c` for Composer. The `z` prefix had history from the Zellij era but no longer carried meaning.

`tx` was appealing for being 2 chars with clear tmux association. But `mux` stood out — instantly communicable, self-documenting, and can be aliased to anything shorter (e.g., `alias x=mux`) per user preference.

### Decision

**Rename to `mux`.**

- Command: `mux`
- Config location: `~/.config/mux/`
- Homebrew formula: `mux`
- Repository: rename from `zw` to `mux`
- 3 chars is fine — user will alias to a single char if needed

**Spec impact:** Global find-replace of `zw` → `mux` throughout. All CLI commands become `mux`, `mux .`, `mux list`, `mux attach`, etc.

---

## How does utility mode work with tmux?

### Context

The Zellij spec had a restricted "utility mode" when running inside Zellij (detected via `ZELLIJ` env var). Attaching and creating sessions were blocked to prevent nesting. Only rename, view, and kill were allowed.

### Journey

tmux sets the `TMUX` env var inside sessions — same detection mechanism.

But tmux has `switch-client` (verified, alias: `switchc`):
```
tmux switch-client -t <session-name>
```

This switches the current client to a different session **without nesting**. It also supports `-l` for switching to the last session.

Furthermore, new sessions can be created detached (`new-session -d -s <name> -c <dir>`) and then switched to via `switch-client`. This means there's no technical reason to block *any* operation from inside tmux.

### Decision

**Utility mode becomes a full session picker that switches instead of attaching.** No restrictions needed.

**Detection**: Check `TMUX` env var. If set, mux is running inside tmux.

**Behaviour when inside tmux:**
- `Enter` on a session → `tmux switch-client -t <name>` (instead of `exec tmux attach`)
- `[n] new in project...` → creates session detached (`new-session -d`), then `switch-client` to it
- Kill, rename — all work as normal (rename even works from outside now)
- Current session excluded from list (you're already in it)
- Header shows current session name for context

**Behaviour when outside tmux:**
- `Enter` on a session → `exec tmux attach-session -t <name>`
- `[n] new in project...` → `exec tmux new-session -A -s <name> -c <dir>`

**CLI commands inside tmux:**
- `mux .`, `mux <path>`, `mux <alias>` → create detached + switch-client (instead of blocking)
- `mux attach <name>` → switch-client (instead of blocking)

This is strictly better than the Zellij spec — the full TUI works from everywhere, just with different underlying operations.

**Spec impact:**
- Remove "Utility Mode" as a separate concept with restricted operations
- Replace with: "inside tmux" detection that changes attach → switch-client
- Remove the separate utility mode TUI mockup
- The TUI is the same everywhere, just the action differs

## What session metadata can we display from outside tmux?

### Context

The Zellij spec showed tab count and attached indicator per session. Need to verify what tmux exposes.

### Decision

tmux's `-F` format strings provide clean, structured access to all metadata. Verified on tmux 3.6a:

**`tmux list-sessions -F`** — available per session:
- `#{session_name}` — session name
- `#{session_windows}` — window count
- `#{session_attached}` — number of attached clients (0 = detached, 1+ = attached)
- `#{session_created}` — creation timestamp (unix epoch)

**`tmux list-windows -t <name> -F`** — available per window:
- `#{window_index}` — window number
- `#{window_name}` — window name
- `#{window_panes}` — pane count
- `#{window_active}` — 1 if active window

**`tmux list-clients -F`** — available per client:
- `#{client_session}` — which session the client is in
- `#{client_name}` — client tty

This is actually cleaner than Zellij — no ANSI escape stripping needed, no output format guessing. The `-F` flag gives us exact control over the output format with pipe-delimited fields.

**TUI display per session:**
- Session name
- Window count (e.g., `2 windows`) — equivalent to Zellij's tab count
- Attached indicator (`● attached`) when `session_attached > 0`

Identical to what the Zellij spec showed, just sourced differently.

## How does process handoff (exec) work with tmux?

### Context

The Zellij spec used `exec` to replace mux's process with Zellij when launching a session. This avoided terminal state management — mux's job is done once the user selects.

### Decision

**Same approach, works identically with tmux.**

From outside tmux (bare shell):
- `exec tmux new-session -A -s <name> -c <dir>` — replaces mux's process with tmux
- `exec tmux attach-session -t <name>` — same

From inside tmux:
- No `exec` needed — `switch-client` is a tmux command, not a process replacement
- For new sessions: `tmux new-session -d -s <name> -c <dir>` then `tmux switch-client -t <name>`
- mux exits normally after issuing the tmux commands

No design changes from the Zellij spec — the `exec` pattern carries forward for the outside-tmux case.

---

## What changes for the runtime dependency?

### Decision

Straightforward swap:

- **Runtime dependency**: tmux (was Zellij)
- **Homebrew formula**: `depends_on "tmux"` (was `depends_on "zellij"`)
- **Missing dependency message**: "mux requires tmux. Install with: brew install tmux"
- **Detection**: Check if `tmux` is in `$PATH` at startup

tmux is more widely available than Zellij — likely already installed on most target systems. The Homebrew dependency ensures it regardless.

No design changes needed — same pattern, different binary name.

## Summary

### What Changes

| Area | Zellij Spec | tmux Spec |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | ZW (Zellij Workspaces) | mux |
| **Config location** | `~/.config/zw/` | `~/.config/mux/` |
| **Session operations** | `zellij attach -c`, `zellij list-sessions`, etc. | `tmux new-session -A -s`, `tmux list-sessions`, etc. |
| **Directory for new sessions** | cd to dir, then create | `new-session -c <dir>` — no cd needed |
| **Exited sessions** | EXITED section in TUI, resurrect, delete | Dropped entirely — tmux sessions are alive or gone |
| **Layouts** | KDL layout picker during session creation | Dropped entirely — not needed |
| **Inside-multiplexer mode** | Restricted "utility mode" — blocked attach/create | Full TUI, uses `switch-client` instead of attach |
| **Session info** | Query tab names, strip ANSI codes | `-F` format strings — clean, structured output |
| **Env var detection** | `ZELLIJ` | `TMUX` |
| **Rename from outside** | Not supported (inside only) | Supported via `rename-session -t` |
| **Runtime dependency** | Zellij | tmux |

### What Stays Unchanged

- Go + Bubble Tea TUI
- Project memory (`projects.json` with aliases, names, timestamps)
- File browser for directory discovery
- Git root resolution
- CLI structure (`mux`, `mux .`, `mux <path>`, `mux <alias>`, `mux list`, `mux attach`, `mux clean`, `mux completion`)
- Session naming (project name + nanoid suffix)
- Filter mode, keyboard shortcuts
- Flat config format
- Argument resolution logic (path detection → alias lookup → fallback)
- Distribution (GoReleaser + Homebrew tap)
- `exec` process handoff (outside tmux)
- Mobile-first design philosophy

### Net Effect

The tmux migration **simplifies** the tool:
- No exited sessions section
- No layout picker
- No restricted utility mode — full TUI everywhere
- No ANSI code stripping
- No cd before session creation
- Rename works from outside

### Next Steps

1. Revise specification — update `docs/workflow/specification/zw.md` → new file for `mux`
2. Rename repository — `zw` → `mux`
