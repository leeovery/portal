# Discussion: Session Launch with Command Execution

## Context

When launching a new tmux session via `x <project>`, the user wants the ability to also execute a command inside that session after it's created. Current `cx` hardcodes running `claude` (or `claude --continue`, `claude --resume` depending on variant). The new `portal`/`x` design should generalise this — any command can be passed through, and the whole thing should be aliasable.

## What CLI syntax for passing the command through?

### Options Considered

**A) Double-dash separator**: `x myproject -- claude --resume`
- Standard POSIX convention — everything after `--` is not parsed as flags
- Handles compound commands with their own flags cleanly, no quoting
- Slightly more verbose

**B) Explicit flag**: `x myproject --exec "claude --resume"` / `x -e "claude --resume" myproject`
- Self-documenting
- Aliases naturally: `alias xc='x -e claude'` → `xc myproject` works
- Needs quoting for compound commands

**C) Positional after known args**: `x myproject claude --resume`
- Shortest but ambiguous — is `claude` a project or a command?
- Fragile, rejected immediately

### Journey

Started with double-dash as the obvious POSIX choice. It handles arbitrary compound commands cleanly without quoting. But when exploring aliasing, a problem surfaced: with `--`, the project must come *before* the separator, so `alias xc='x -- claude'` then `xc myproject` expands to `x -- claude myproject` — `myproject` becomes an arg to claude, not to x.

Shell functions solve this (`xc() { x "${1:-.}" -- claude; }`) but that's a step up from simple aliases. The `--exec`/`-e` flag aliases naturally because the flag and its value stay together, with the project as a trailing positional.

Realised the two aren't mutually exclusive — both just express "run this command after session creation." Both normalise to the same internal representation: a `[]string` of command + args.

### Decision

**Support both `-e` and `--`.** They're mutually exclusive (error if both provided). Both resolve to the same internal exec command slice early in CLI parsing. Single downstream code path.

- `-e` / `--exec` for simple commands and clean aliasing: `x -e claude myproject`
- `--` for compound commands with flags, no quoting: `x myproject -- claude --resume --model opus`

## Should the command replace the shell or run then drop to shell?

### Options Considered

**A) Run then drop to shell** — command runs, when it exits you land in zsh at the project dir. Session stays alive.

**B) Replace shell (exec)** — command exits, session dies.

**C) User decides via flag** — default A, add `--replace` for B.

### Journey

Current `cx` uses A: `zsh -ic '$cmd; exec zsh'`. If claude crashes or you ctrl+c, you don't lose the session. Option C adds surface area for a niche case — if someone really wants exec-and-die they can pass `exec claude` as the command itself.

### Decision

**A — run then drop to shell.** No flag needed. Users wanting exec behaviour can literally pass `exec` as part of the command: `x myproject -- exec claude`.

---

## How does this interact with the TUI flow?

### Context

When no project is specified, `x` opens the TUI picker. What happens when a command is specified but no project?

### Options Considered

**A) TUI opens, command applies after selection** — the command is "sticky" through the selection flow. Pick project → session created → command runs.

**B) Error — require project when command specified.**

### Journey

B would kill the alias use case. `alias xc='x -e claude'` then just `xc` to get picker + claude would fail. The command is an instruction for what to do *after* session creation, orthogonal to *how* the project was chosen (argument, alias, zoxide, TUI).

Confirmed this means `xc` (→ `x -e claude`) works consistently:
- `xc` → TUI → pick project → claude
- `xc myproject` → direct → claude
- `xc .` → current dir → claude

### Decision

**A — command is orthogonal to project resolution.** TUI opens normally, command applies after selection. Consistent behaviour regardless of how the project was resolved.

## Should projects.json support default commands per project?

### Journey

The aliasing approach already solves "I always want claude with this project" at the shell level. Adding per-project exec config in projects.json means more config surface, precedence rules (CLI vs config — which wins?), and potentially surprising behaviour if you forget a project has a default.

Also corrected a misunderstanding: aliases in the portal design are NOT properties of projects. They live in a separate flat map as independent routing shortcuts — decided in the x-xctl-split discussion.

### Decision

**Skip — YAGNI.** Use the tool first, feel the friction, add config later if a real pattern emerges. Shell aliases/functions cover the known use cases without adding config surface prematurely.

---

## How does this relate to the existing cx variants (cx, cx c, cx r)?

### Context

Current `cx` has hardcoded claude-specific subcommands:
- `cx` / `cx n` → new session + `claude`
- `cx c` → new session + `claude --continue`
- `cx r` → new session + `claude --resume`

### Decision

**cx is fully replaced by portal/x. No claude-specific functionality in x.**

Portal is a command-agnostic session manager. It doesn't know or care about claude. The generalised exec mechanism (`-e` / `--`) makes the old hardcoded variants unnecessary at the tool level.

The user creates whatever personal shortcuts they want in their shell config:
```bash
alias xc='x -e claude'
alias xcc='x -e "claude --continue"'
alias xcr='x -e "claude --resume"'
```

Clean separation of concerns: x manages sessions, shell aliases encode personal workflows.

## Summary

### Key Insights

1. Exec is orthogonal to project resolution — the command applies regardless of how the project was chosen (direct, alias, zoxide, TUI)
2. `-e` and `--` aren't competing syntaxes — they're complementary. `-e` for aliases, `--` for compound commands. Same internal code path.
3. Portal should be command-agnostic. Claude-specific shortcuts belong in user shell config, not baked into the tool.
4. "Run then drop to shell" is the safe default. `exec` as a command prefix is the escape hatch — no flag needed.

### Current State

- All five questions resolved
- No open items

### Next Steps

- [ ] Update mux specification to include exec functionality
- [ ] Remove claude-specific references from spec if any remain
