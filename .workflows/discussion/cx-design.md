# Discussion: CX Tool Design

## Context

CX (Claude eXecute) is a Go CLI for managing Claude Code sessions with Zellij support.

**The actual problem**: When SSH/Mosh-ing to a machine (e.g., from phone to Mac), it's tedious to navigate to the right project directory and attach to/start the right Zellij session. Want a single command that handles everything.

**Core workflow**:
1. SSH/Mosh to machine (outside CX scope)
2. Run `cx`
3. See unified view of sessions/projects
4. Pick one → CX handles cd + session management

## What is CX and what problem does it solve?

### Decision

CX is a **multi-purpose startup command** for Claude Code sessions with Zellij. Single entry point that handles:
- Listing active sessions and known projects
- Attaching to existing sessions
- Starting new sessions
- Directory navigation

**Not in scope**: Remote access itself (handled by SSH/Mosh separately).

---

## What are the core capabilities?

### Decision

From unified TUI, user can:

1. **Attach to existing session** - select running session, CX does cd + attach
2. **Start new session for known project** - select project with no active session, CX does cd + start
3. **Start new session in current directory** - quick option always available
4. **Start new session in new directory** - fuzzy search through configured path (e.g., ~/Code)
5. **Multiple sessions per project** - supported, can start new even if one running

**Keyboard shortcuts while navigating list**:
- `A` - Attach to existing session
- `N` - New session (even if one already running)
- `C` - Start with `claude --continue`
- `R` - Start with `claude --resume`
- `K` - Kill session (with confirmation)
- Arrow keys / typing for navigation + fuzzy filter

**Housekeeping**:
- Remove dead projects from list (directory no longer exists)

---

## UI interaction model

### Context

Need a clean, keyboard-driven TUI that handles both session management and project selection without being confusing.

### Options Considered

**Flat list** - all items together, sessions and projects mixed
- Pro: Simple
- Con: Unclear what action Enter performs on each item type

**Grouped** - sections for "Active Sessions" and "Recent Projects"
- Pro: Clear separation
- Con: Implies active sessions are only for attaching, but user wants to start new sessions from active projects too

**Flat with drill-down** - projects only in main list, drill into sub-picker for sessions
- Pro: Clean main view, focused sub-view for session management
- Con: Extra navigation level

### Decision

**Flat list with drill-down** - two-level navigation.

#### Main List

Shows projects only (flat, sorted by recency):
```
> myapp          ● 2 active
  dotfiles       ● 1 active
  api-server
  website
  ──────────────
  [.] current directory
  [/] find new...
```

**Keyboard shortcuts at main list level**:
- Arrow keys / typing → navigate + fuzzy filter
- `N` → cd to project + start new session
- `C` → cd to project + start with `claude --continue`
- `R` → cd to project + start with `claude --resume`
- `K` → kill all sessions for project (with confirmation)
- `Enter` → drill into sub-picker (if sessions exist) OR prompt to start (if no sessions)

#### Sub-picker (when drilling into project with sessions)

Focus is on managing existing sessions:
```
myapp
──────────────
> session 1    2h ago (attached)
  session 2    30m ago
  ──────────────
  Start new session for myapp

[esc] back
```

**Keyboard shortcuts in sub-picker**:
- `Enter` on session → attach to it
- `K` on session → kill that session (with confirmation)
- `Enter` on "Start new session" → starts new
- `Esc` → back to main list

Note: N/C/R not shown in sub-picker - if user wants those flags, they select "Start new session" which could then prompt for mode, or they back out to main list and use shortcuts there.

#### No sessions scenario

When pressing `Enter` on a project with no active sessions:
- Shows prompt: "Start new session for api-server?"
- Options: Normal / Continue / Resume
- Keeps behavior consistent and explicit

### Nice to Have

**Attached device info**: Show which device is attached to a session (e.g., "attached - Lee's iPhone"). Zellij shows attached state but not the connecting device. Would need to map TTY to SSH connection via `who` or similar. Defer to post-MVP.

---

## Directory discovery

### Context

When user wants to start a session in a new project (not already in the project list), how do they find it without manually cd-ing first?

### Options Considered

**Configured search path with flat fuzzy search**
- Configure root(s) like `~/Code`, scan 2-3 levels deep
- `[/]` opens fuzzy finder over all found dirs
- Pro: Simple, fast
- Con: Might miss deeply nested projects, requires upfront scanning, config complexity

**Interactive file browser**
- `[/]` opens browser starting at ~ (or configured root)
- Shows directories only, navigate with arrows
- Enter to descend, Esc to go up
- N/C/R to select current dir and start session
- Typing filters current level
- Pro: Handles any depth, no scanning needed, matches mental model
- Con: Slightly more to build

**Hybrid** - flat search with fallback to browser
- More complex, unclear benefit

### Decision

**Interactive file browser** (Option B).

When user selects `[/] find new...`:
- Opens browser at ~ (could make starting point configurable later)
- Shows directories only (not files)
- Arrow keys to navigate list
- `Enter` to descend into highlighted directory
- `Esc` to go up one level (or exit browser if at root)
- Typing filters directories at current level
- `N`/`C`/`R` to select current directory and start session with respective mode

Once a directory is selected and session started, it gets added to the project list automatically.

---

## Session management

### Context

Need to handle naming for both projects and sessions, especially when directory names alone aren't descriptive (e.g., "api" could be any project's api folder).

### Decision

#### Project naming

- **Directory path is the unique key** - two projects can't have the same path
- **Custom display name** - stored separately from path
- **On first session in new directory**: prompt "Project name?" with default = directory basename
- User can accept default or customize (e.g., "api" → "project-a-api")
- Name cached in project registry, used for all future sessions in that directory
- **Rename mechanism**: keyboard shortcut in main list (not `R` - that's resume; decide binding later)

#### Session naming

- Format: `{project-name}-{NN}` (e.g., `project-a-api-01`)
- Uses custom project name, not raw directory basename
- Numbers increment, never reused (even after sessions die) to avoid confusion
- Two-digit padding (01, 02... 99) - sufficient for practical use

#### Display in UI

- **Main list**: shows custom project name
- **Sub-picker**: shows "session 1", "session 2" (friendly) - project context already clear from header
- Internal Zellij session name (`project-a-api-01`) is an implementation detail, not shown to user

---

## Data storage

### Decision

Location: `~/.config/cx/`

**Config** (separate file): `config.yaml`
- User preferences, defaults
- See Configuration section

**Data** (JSON files):

`projects.json`:
```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "path": "/Users/lee/Code/project-a/api",
      "name": "project-a-api",
      "alias": "api",
      "last_used": "2026-01-22T10:30:00Z",
      "next_session_num": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: `alias` is optional, must be unique across all projects.

`sessions.json`:
```json
{
  "sessions": {
    "project-a-api-01": {
      "project_path": "/Users/lee/Code/project-a/api",
      "created": "2026-01-22T10:30:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

**Why sessions.json**: Zellij tracks session state (running/exited/attached) but not which directory it belongs to. We need the mapping to cd correctly before attaching.

**Cleanup**: When sessions are killed/deleted, remove from sessions.json. Periodic cleanup of orphaned entries (Zellij session gone but still in our file).

---

## Zellij integration

### Context

Zellij is what makes CX valuable - without it, we're just cd-ing and running Claude. The persistent sessions, crash survival, and multi-device attach all come from Zellij.

### Decision

**Zellij is a hard dependency.** If not installed, CX errors with a helpful message ("CX requires Zellij. Install with: brew install zellij").

No raw/fallback mode - it would undermine the tool's purpose.

### Layout

Current understanding: Zellij layouts define pane structure. We need a layout that:
- Opens single pane
- Immediately runs Claude

**Options** (need research):
1. CX installs layout to `~/.config/zellij/layouts/cx.kdl` on first run
2. CX passes inline layout or layout file path to Zellij at session creation
3. User manages layout separately, CX references by name from config

**Leaning toward**: Option 1 or 2 - CX manages the layout so user doesn't have to configure Zellij manually. Reduces friction.

### Session operations

**Creating**: `zellij attach -c <session-name>` (creates if doesn't exist)
- Need to verify: how to specify layout? `--layout` flag?

**Attaching**: `zellij attach <session-name>`

**Listing**: `zellij list-sessions` - parse output for session names + status

**Killing**: `zellij kill-session <session-name>`

**Deleting** (exited sessions): `zellij delete-session <session-name>`

### Research needed

- [ ] Exact syntax for creating session with layout
- [ ] Can we pass layout inline or must it be a file?
- [ ] Best location for CX-managed layout file
- [ ] What info does `zellij list-sessions` output include? (attached status, etc.)

---

## Configuration

### Context

Need to decide what's configurable vs opinionated. YAGNI applies - don't add config options we don't need.

### Decision

**Minimal configuration.** Be opinionated on defaults.

**Format**: Flat key=value file (like Ghostty), not YAML/JSON.
- Simpler to parse and edit
- Easier future updates, fewer breaking changes
- Overrides defaults only - if not set, use default

Location: `~/.config/cx/config`

```
# Example config (all optional, these are defaults)
claude-args=
```

**Config options** (MVP):
- `claude-args` - Default args passed to Claude (e.g., `--dangerously-skip-permissions`). Empty by default.

**Not configurable** (opinionated):
- File browser start path → uses current directory
- Timestamp display format → pick something sensible
- Session naming format → `{project}-{NN}`
- Themes → none for now

**Future**: Add config options only when real need emerges.

---

## CLI interface

### Context

Research doc had many subcommands (`cx list`, `cx kill`, `cx projects`, etc.). But TUI handles most operations - do we need them?

### Decision

**Minimalist approach.** Main command handles most cases, positional arg for shortcuts.

#### Main command

- `cx` → full TUI picker
- `cx .` → current directory context
  - If project known: shows options (new session / attach to existing)
  - If not known: prompts to create project
- `cx <project>` → fuzzy match on name, alias, or path
  - Single match: shows options for that project
  - Multiple matches: "Your input was ambiguous, did you mean one of these?" → picker to select

#### Subcommands (minimal)

- `cx clean` / `cx prune` → remove dead/exited sessions (non-interactive)
- `cx version` → version info
- `cx help` → usage help

**Not needed**:
- `cx list` → `cx` by itself shows the list
- `cx kill` → use TUI with `K` shortcut

#### Aliases

Projects can have an optional alias for quick access:
- Stored in project registry alongside name and path
- Must be **unique across all projects** - no duplicates allowed
- `cx api` matches alias "api" directly

**Fuzzy matching vs exact alias**:
- Alias match is exact and takes priority
- Fuzzy match can be ambiguous (multiple results) - that's OK, user picks from list
- Example: projects "api-v1" and "api-v2", user types `cx api` → shows both, user picks

---

## Distribution

### Decision

**Homebrew** as primary distribution for macOS (and Linux where Homebrew is available).

#### Homebrew tap

- Repository: `github.com/leeovery/homebrew-tools`
- Formula declares `depends_on "zellij"` - installed automatically
- Installation: `brew tap leeovery/tools && brew install cx`

#### Platforms

- macOS (arm64, amd64)
- Linux (arm64, amd64)

#### Build automation: GoReleaser

Modern standard for Go CLI distribution. Handles:
- Cross-compilation for all platforms
- Creates GitHub releases with versioned archives
- Auto-generates/updates Homebrew formula in tap repo
- Integrates with GitHub Actions

**Release workflow**:
1. Run release script (generates tag with AI commit message)
2. Push tag
3. GitHub Action triggers, runs GoReleaser
4. GoReleaser builds binaries, creates GitHub Release
5. GoReleaser pushes updated formula to `leeovery/homebrew-tools`

#### Linux without Homebrew

GoReleaser creates `.tar.gz` archives. Options:
- Manual download from GitHub Releases
- Simple install script that curls release and extracts to `/usr/local/bin`

#### Files needed

- `.goreleaser.yaml` - GoReleaser config
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - GitHub Action for releases
- `release.sh` - Tag/release script (user will provide)

## Summary

### What is CX

A Go CLI for managing Claude Code sessions with Zellij. Single entry point (`cx`) that handles listing projects/sessions, attaching to existing sessions, and starting new ones - all with automatic directory navigation.

### Key decisions

1. **Zellij is required** - no fallback mode, it's the core value
2. **Two-level TUI** - flat project list, drill into sub-picker for sessions
3. **Keyboard-driven** - N/C/R to start sessions, K to kill, Enter to drill/select
4. **Custom project names** - prompted on first use, stored with path as key
5. **Aliases** - optional, unique, for quick `cx <alias>` access
6. **Minimal CLI** - `cx`, `cx .`, `cx <project>`, `cx clean`
7. **Flat config** - key=value format, minimal options
8. **GoReleaser + Homebrew** - modern Go distribution

### Research deferred to implementation

- Zellij layout mechanics (creating sessions with layout, layout file location)

### Nice-to-haves deferred

- Attached device info (show which device connected to session)

### Next steps

Ready for specification and planning phases.
