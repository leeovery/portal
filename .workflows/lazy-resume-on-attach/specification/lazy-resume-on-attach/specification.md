# Specification: Lazy Resume On Attach

## Specification

### 1. What This Feature Changes

Portal restores every saved session on each reboot, and every restored pane fires its registered resume hook as part of coming back — whether or not the user ever looks at that pane. The firing is unconditional once scrollback replay finishes: the hydrate helper looks the pane's baked hook key up in the store and, on a hit, execs `sh -c '<HOOK>; exec $SHELL'` (`cmd/state_hydrate.go:172-196`). A restored pane is either a running process or a plain shell — there is no third state.

The cost is memory, and it scales with the saved-session count rather than with what the user is working on. Measured on a 64 GB M1 MacBook Pro on 2026-08-21: 42 live Claude processes, 13.1 GB resident between them, averaging 318 MB each and peaking at 702 MB, with the pageout counter over a million. Every new piece of work adds a session that is resumed on every subsequent reboot, indefinitely, regardless of whether it is still active work.

**The feature introduces the third state.** A restored pane whose resume is lazy comes back holding a panel that states what is about to be run and waits for the user to answer it. The live process behind the pane starts when the user says so, not at boot.

**Everything else about restore is unchanged.** Skeleton, geometry and scrollback replay exactly as today, so the pane still reads as restored — the transcript the user left there sits in the pane's primary buffer the whole time the panel waits, and is revealed the moment the panel goes.

Figures about the install are point-in-time, not constants. Measured across three sittings: 44 live sessions against 41 registered resume hooks (2026-09-17), 42 against 41, then 43 against 40 (2026-09-18). No figure supersedes another. The shape they agree on is one session, one pane, one registration — 43 of the 44 live sessions held a single pane (`tmux list-panes -a -F '#{session_name}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{print $1}' | sort -n | uniq -c` → `43 × 1 pane, 1 × 2 panes`, 2026-09-17) — and a set that grows over months.
