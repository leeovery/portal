# Specification: Spectrum TUI Design

> **⚠ Corrigendum — 2026-06-22 (spectrum-tui-design implementation, tasks 3-9 / 3-10).**
> The focus/edit **visual grammar** in §8.2, §8.4 and §13.1 was revised during implementation after confirming on a real terminal that (a) a glyph-drawn thin border **cannot coexist with a background fill** (the fill overlaps the border glyphs or leaves a gap), so **nothing fills** — not inputs, not chips; and (b) a single violet treatment can't distinguish *focused* from *editing* on a chip (a field holds many chips you navigate among before editing one).
> - **Superseded:** §13.1 — "outline = focused, fill = editing" and "the Name field in edit mode also turns violet-filled"; §8.2 chip states — focused = "`accent.violet` outline + a violet `✕`", editing = "`accent.violet` fill + cursor", indicator "`◉ EDIT MODE` (`accent.violet`)"; §8.4 rename input "violet `▌` cursor".
> - **Current:** state is carried by **border colour, never a fill** — **grey** (`border.separator`, unfocused/normal) → **`accent.violet`** (focused) → **`accent.orange`** (editing, + live cursor); the **`◉ EDIT MODE`** header indicator is **`accent.orange`**, shown only while editing. **Inputs render rounded corners, chips render square** (the element-type differentiator). Chips drop the inline `✕` (removal is `x` on a focused chip; the footer carries `x remove`). The rename modal's single always-editing input is therefore **`accent.orange`** with the `◉ EDIT MODE` badge (§8.4 / task 3-10). See the revised §8.2 and §13.1.
> - **Also added this session:** `↑`/`↓` as field-navigation aliases in the edit modal (§8.2 navigate mode) — a convenience requested during implementation; and the editing-in-place footer right-aligns the `empty on save = delete` consequence note (matches the §8.2 reference frame).
> - **§9 preview chrome restructure (design refinement, task 4-6):** the preview is now a **full-screen joined panel** (the modal `renderJoinedPanel` shape, single-tone `accent.cyan`, rounded, no fill) with **header / body / footer** compartments — the nav hints moved from the header into a **footer** (`accent.blue` glyphs + `text.detail` labels, space-separated). The window **binding changed** to `←`/`→` (was `]`/`[`); **pane stays `Tab`** (`Ctrl+←/→` was considered but rejected — it collides with macOS Mission Control Spaces switching); the marker is `◉` (was `⊙`). Footer reads `←→ window  ⇥ pane  ⏎ attach  ␣ back`.
> Bodies below were edited in place to match; this block is the only annotation. Original wording is recoverable via `git log -p`.

> **⚠ Corrigendum — 2026-06-25 (spectrum-tui-design review).**
> The §2.9 MV token-table **light column**, the §7.3 **no-matches glyph**, and the §11.3 **signpost text token** were reconciled to the as-built implementation (the spec lagged the build-time §1-4 / §1-9 validation and a deliberate info-band consistency decision).
> - **§2.9 light variants & ratios.** The original light *ratio* column was computed against pure white `#FFFFFF`; §2.3 / §2.9 mandate measuring each light variant against the **owned light canvas `#e1e2e7`**. During validation, seven light foreground hexes were darkened (hue-preserved) to clear the floor against the real canvas, and `state.green`'s light value was folded to a single `#3B5E18` that clears **both** the canvas and the `bg.selection` tint (retiring the former light-only on-selection override). **Superseded → current:** `text.muted-bright` `#515A80`→`#4C5478`; `text.detail` `#5A6296`→`#586093`; `text.dim` `#7C84AA`→`#767DA2`; `accent.blue` `#2E5FD0`→`#2D5CCA`; `accent.cyan` `#0E7490`→`#0D6C87`; `state.green` `#4C7A1F`→`#3B5E18`; `state.red` `#C32647`→`#BD2545`. The light **ratio** column now reads vs `#e1e2e7` (on-tint tokens — `text.on-selection`, `text.on-warning` — measured against their tint). The two light surface tints that were `(§15)` placeholders are pinned: `bg.warning` `#E8D6A8`, `bg.track` `#D2D4DE`. Every light value is numerically re-verified in `internal/tui/theme/contrast_test.go`.
> - **§7.3 no-matches glyph.** Superseded: `⌀` (U+2300 DIAMETER SIGN). Current: **`∅`** (U+2205 EMPTY SET) — chosen at build time for wider terminal-font support and a more apt "no results" semantics.
> - **§11.3 / §2.9 signpost text token.** Superseded: the "No tags yet" signpost message in `text.strong` (and `text.strong`'s §2.9 role line listing "banner/signpost"). Current: **`text.on-selection`** — the on-band token co-tuned for the `bg.selection` info-band tint, chosen deliberately so the signpost matches the §11.4 command-pending banner (all persistent info bands share the same on-band token). `text.strong`'s §2.9 role drops "banner/signpost" accordingly. Both candidate tokens clear the floor on the tint (`text.on-selection` 10.5:1, `text.strong` 5.7:1 light); the choice is consistency, not legibility.
> Bodies above (§2.9, §7.3, §11.3) were edited in place to match; this block is the only annotation. Original wording is recoverable via `git log -p`.

## Specification

> **⚠ Verification mandate — applies to every task (read before planning).**
> This is a visual reskin, so correctness is *visual*. **Every plan task MUST carry explicit visual-verification steps in its acceptance criteria** — not just "tests pass". For each task:
> 1. Add or extend the task's **`vhs` tape** to drive the TUI to the screen/state it changes and write a PNG (`vhs <tape>` — harness + setup in §15).
> 2. Compare the captured PNG against the task's **named Paper frame** (§15 frame map) for **layout, structure, and colour-role match**.
> 3. Confirm **behaviour parity** with the pre-reskin implementation (§1 "Reskin, not rebuild").
>
> A task is **not done** until its `vhs` capture is produced and checked against its frame.
>
> **This is a per-task requirement distributed across the plan — never a single dedicated "verification" task.** It applies to **every task that produces or changes UI** (anything that renders a screen, surface, or element comparable to a Paper frame). Each such task **carries the information to perform the check itself**: its named Paper frame(s) (§15.1), the `vhs` tape that drives the TUI to that state, and the compare step (§15.5). Where a Paper-comparable surface is only complete after several tasks build it up, the check attaches to the task — or phase boundary — that first reaches that comparable state. Purely non-visual tasks (plumbing with no rendered output) are exempt; any task touching rendering is in. **Planning MUST embed these checks per-task.** §15 defines the `vhs` harness, its setup, the frame map, and the comparison mechanism.

## 1. Overview & Design Direction

### Goal
Portal's TUI is functional but personality-free. This redesign gives it a colourful, characterful visual identity that makes Portal nicer and more exciting to use. Portal **owns a mode-matched canvas**: it respects the user's light/dark mode but neutralises the background shade, painting its own canonical backdrop so MV's colours always sit on the surface they were tuned for. The shipping bar is concrete: the result must be a genuine improvement over today's UI — both *objectively* (clears the contrast floor, §2 — guaranteed against the exact owned canvas) and on the user's *subjective* read. Bailing is a legitimate outcome if no direction clears that bar; this is an explicit anti-sunk-cost gate.

### Locked direction — Modern Vivid
The visual language is **Modern Vivid (MV)**: a restrained, modern palette (violet / cyan / green accents, plus an orange filter accent) with light retro touches grafted on (wordmark + caret + separator rule). It is **not** a literal Spectrum reproduction:

- **No rainbow / multi-hue spectrum motif** — the multi-hue rainbow is firmly excluded (unwanted pride-flag association). Colour is used heavily, but never as a rainbow.
- **The canvas is mode-matched, not pure black** — Portal owns a near-black (dark) / near-white (light) backdrop (see Canvas ownership below), not a literal black-on-every-terminal scheme.

MV keeps the structural/typographic ideas (wordmark, separators, spaced headers, chunky selector, honest loading screen) and pairs them with its own colour scheme.

### Canvas ownership — Portal owns a mode-matched canvas
Portal detects the terminal's light/dark mode and paints its **own opaque canvas** on every cell: an inky near-black **`#0b0c14`** in dark mode, a soft near-white **`#e1e2e7`** in light mode (both Tokyo-Night-derived). Owning the canvas makes the contrast floor (§2.3) **guaranteed** — every token is measured against the exact surface it renders on, never an arbitrary terminal background.

- **Painted on every cell, two layers.** Every cell carries the canvas bg: (1) leaf styles carry `.Background(canvas)` so every text/accent run paints its own cells, and (2) an **outer-layer full-terminal fill** (a container sized `Width=termW · Height=termH · Background=canvas`, or `lipgloss.Place` + `WithWhitespaceBackground`) pads every line to full width and fills full height, so no edge bleeds and empty mid-screen rows are painted. The fill is an **outer-layer wrap** (not per-delegate-row painting) with the list's width/height budget unchanged — it must **not** perturb the one-row-per-delegate pagination invariant (§3.5, §4.1). The outer fill is the **last** layer: it wraps the already-composed view (header + any notice band + list + footer, summed to `termH`), so a dynamic vertical change — e.g. the §11.2 flash band appearing or clearing — drives the list's height recompute **underneath** the fill, which simply re-pads to `termH`. The fill never participates in the list's height budget.
- **Per-element backgrounds remain.** Selected-row tint, status strips, modal panels, etc. are focus/structure styling layered over the canvas; each must clear the contrast floor against the exact canvas (§2.3 / §2.9).
- **Opaque-only in v1.** A "use terminal background" transparency opt-out is **deferred** to the user-theme system (§2.8 / §16); v1 ships one render path. `NO_COLOR` is the one carve-out (§2.5).

### Nothing is sacred
The current UI carries no special claim. Today's pink cursor (`212`), green=attached (`76`), grey detail text (`#777777`), and blue preview border may all be replaced wholesale. The redesign may restructure colour, layout, and UI — and, where justified, UX — but only where "the juice is worth the squeeze." Code may change in service of good UI; gratuitous restructure is avoided. Every design decision is validated against how Portal actually works before being adopted.

### Reskin, not rebuild (applies throughout)
This feature is a **visual reskin** of the existing TUI, **not** a reimplementation. The specification describes the **styling target** (palette tokens, glyphs, layout treatment) and the **behaviour it must preserve** — it is not a rebuild brief. The existing list model, grouping logic, directory resolution, persistence, resolution chain, and keybinding plumbing are **already implemented and must stay behaviourally identical**; implementation **restyles existing render code** (per the feasibility audit §14) rather than re-deriving the machinery.

**Changing existing code is explicitly permitted** where a restyle genuinely requires it — reworking a row delegate, centralising colour into tokens, adjusting a layout/measurement calc are all in-bounds; a reskin is not limited to additive styling. The bar is **like-for-like behaviour**: whenever existing code is touched, verify the new behaviour against the current implementation (read it, trace every path, diff the logic) so the change is **provably cosmetic**. Behaviour parity — not "did we avoid touching the file" — is the acceptance test.

Where a section documents existing behaviour, treat it as a **constraint to preserve**, not a task to build. Genuinely **new** work is flagged explicitly and is limited to: the `?` help modal, the header/wordmark + separator block, edit-modal chips, the **role-token colour layer + light/dark detection + owned-canvas paint** (§2.6 / §2.9), and the cold-path startup flip (§10). **If implementing a section would mean re-deriving logic that already exists, restyle in place and verify parity instead of rebuilding** — that is the anti-bug guardrail.

---

## 2. Colour System & Terminal Robustness

### 2.1 Design to roles, not fixed hex
Every renderer references a small fixed set of **semantic role tokens**, never scattered literal hex. The redesign is built on this role-token colour layer; concrete values are pinned in §2.9 (MV token table).

Roles:
- **primary accent** — cursor / selection / active title / header caret. *(MV: violet.)*
- **key-hint** — footer / modal key glyphs. *(MV: blue.)*
- **detail** — paths / secondary text / metadata / counts, across a **tonal ramp** (bright → faint; pinned in §2.9). *(MV: blue-greys.)*
- **state — attached** — the live/attached marker. *(MV: green; reserved for **live / positive** signals — the attached marker, Sessions count, Projects label, `✓` done-tick, success flash — never chips or decoration.)*
- **state — destructive** — kill/delete confirmation emphasis. *(MV: red; reserved for destructive actions only.)*
- **filter / search & warning / transient** — filter query and inline flash share one warm token. *(MV: orange.)*
- **preview mode-chrome** — the read-only preview frame, deliberately distinct from the primary violet to signal "peek mode." *(MV: cyan.)*

Each role has **light and dark variants** (resolved via explicit light/dark detection — §2.6). A direction instantiates the roles; the roles are the stable interface the rest of the spec refers to.

### 2.2 State is never carried by hue alone
Every state is conveyed by **glyph + colour**, never colour alone: `●` attached, `▌` selector bar, `✕` removable/destructive, spaced uppercase headers, `⚠` warning, `✓` success. Colour, where available, only *reinforces* the glyph. This makes the monochrome / `NO_COLOR` path work for free and protects colour-blind users. (Consistent with the prior `preview-visual-distinction` rule: don't rely on colour alone.)

### 2.3 Contrast floor (hard gate)
Every foreground token must clear a contrast gate **before taste is judged**. Functional foreground — session names, paths, footer, status text — must meet **WCAG AA**:
- **4.5:1** for normal text,
- **3:1** for large/bold text and UI accents (cursor, border, selection highlight),

measured against the **exact owned canvas** for its mode: the **dark variant on `#0b0c14`** and the **light variant on `#e1e2e7`**, each ≥ its ratio. **The two variants resolve independently** — each is measured only against its own mode-canvas, so no single value need hold on both. The gate's scope is **every** rendered element, not just the base text column: all foreground tokens, **all per-element tints/bands** (selected-row tint, the amber/violet/green left-bar accents, status strips, chip states), **and** every **foreground-on-tint** pairing. Purely decorative glyphs (the wordmark) are exempt from the text ratio but must stay visible. Because the canvas is owned, the floor is **guaranteed**: there is no arbitrary terminal background to defeat it. A token that can't hit the floor against its canvas is **adjusted toward more contrast** (the remedy rule, §2.9) — never shipped under-floor.

### 2.4 Colour-capability ladder (truecolor / 256 / 16)
Portal **imposes its own exact hues via truecolor**, painted on the owned canvas — it does **not** inherit the terminal's 16 ANSI colours. Rationale: a recognisable identity needs consistent hues across machines; inheriting the user's palette means no identity and possible clashes. Honouring `NO_COLOR` (§2.5) covers "don't fight the user" for anyone who opts out of colour entirely. Lipgloss/termenv **auto-downsamples** to 256/16 on weaker terminals — accepted as graceful degradation (a hue may approximate, but the contrast floor still governs legibility). Matches existing repo practice (`previewBorderColor`).

### 2.5 NO_COLOR / monochrome
Portal **honours `NO_COLOR`** and monochrome terminals: it renders colourless, leaning on the glyph-backed state (§2.2) plus bold/dim attributes. Because state is never colour-only, the UI stays fully usable without colour.

Under `NO_COLOR`, Portal **paints no canvas at all** — it renders on the terminal's **native fg/bg**. This is the one documented carve-out to the single owned-canvas render path (§1): `NO_COLOR` imposes *no* hues, so falling back to the terminal's own default fg-on-bg is legible **by construction** — a second, distinct, colourless render path whose legibility guarantee is the terminal's own defaults.

This carve-out applies to **every** canvas-dependent surface, not just the base list: under `NO_COLOR` the **modal blank-screen** (§8.1 / §13.5) clears to the terminal's native bg (no painted canvas), **notice bands** (§11.2 inline flash, §11.3/§11.4 mode bands) drop their tint and bar colour — the band stays present via its `▌` left-bar and position — and carry the **state** through the message text plus, on the flashes, the `⚠`/`✓` glyph and bold/dim (§2.2), and the **preview chrome** (§9.2) renders colourless on the native bg. The captured preview *content* is already out-of-theme real ANSI regardless (§9.2).

### 2.6 Light/dark detection & canvas selection
Portal owns a mode-matched canvas (§1), so it must decide **which** canvas — light or dark — to paint. This is a detection-plus-override decision; with an owned canvas a wrong guess is only a cosmetic light/dark surprise, never an illegibility (the floor holds against whichever canvas is painted).

- **Mechanism — OSC 11.** Detect the terminal's background luminance via an **OSC 11 query** (`tea.RequestBackgroundColor` → `BackgroundColorMsg` in Bubble Tea v2) → light/dark. (`COLORFGBG` is a weak secondary hint only; OSC 11 is the real signal. Lipgloss v2 removed `AdaptiveColor`, so detection is **explicit**, not framework-implicit.)
- **When — per launch, at startup.** Run once each launch; no caching (the theme is stable mid-session, the query is cheap, always fresh).
- **Flip avoidance.** The reply is async, so **gate the first real paint on "detection resolved OR a short timeout (tens of ms)"** — Portal never paints one canvas then flips to the other. Terminals that answer (single-digit ms) paint the right canvas from frame one; a non-responding terminal falls through to the fallback after a brief, invisible wait. **The cold-path loading page (§10) gates the same way** — it paints the correct canvas from its first frame; the tens-of-ms detection is invisible against the multi-hundred-ms bootstrap, and the first frame still lands well under the ~100 ms "instant" threshold.
- **Fallback default — dark.** A no-answer resolves to the **dark** canvas (most terminal users run dark; termenv defaults dark; MV is dark-first). A mis-detected light-terminal user gets a legible-but-wrong-mode screen — cosmetic, not broken — with the `appearance` override as recourse.
- **Override — `appearance` pref (new, v1 scope).** `prefs.json` carries `appearance: auto | light | dark` (default `auto`), sitting beside `session_list_mode`. `auto` detects with the dark fallback; `light`/`dark` **pin the mode and skip detection** (also skipping the startup detection wait). This is the recourse for terminals (notably tmux passthrough) where OSC 11 misdetects. It is **not a second render path** — both light and dark are owned-canvas paths that exist regardless — so it is cheap.
- **`NO_COLOR` skips detection.** Under `NO_COLOR` (§2.5) there is no canvas to select, so light/dark detection and its first-paint wait are skipped entirely.

### 2.7 Narrow / short terminal — degrade, never break
Define a **minimum supported terminal size**; below it the UI **degrades** rather than breaks: drop the wordmark → compact wordmark, drop the right-side header hint, truncate names with `…`, and let height drive pagination. It must **never overflow** — the one-row-per-delegate pagination invariant always holds (every list row, header or session, is exactly one delegate line). Exact thresholds are pinned as an implementation detail.

**Degrade is progressive and per-dimension, not all-at-once.** Width-driven steps apply in order as width shrinks — (1) drop the right-side header hint, (2) wordmark → compact, (3) truncate names with `…`; height continues to drive pagination independently. Each step has its own trigger (exact thresholds deferred to implementation), so a short-but-wide terminal keeps the full wordmark and a narrow-but-tall one keeps full pagination.

### 2.8 Theming — tokenise now, user-override deferred
- **In scope:** structure the role-token colour layer as a single named built-in theme ("Modern Vivid"). Every renderer references **tokens**, not scattered hex. This locks layout and delegates colour, making the app theme-*ready* at near-zero extra cost.
- **Semantic role tokens, not per-element.** Every distinct rendered value is a **named role token** — reuse a token on a genuine role-match, promote a **new named role** where the value genuinely differs, **never raw hex** at a call site. (Two legitimately distinct roles stay two tokens — e.g. the 2-tone borders `border.separator` + `border.footer`.) Per-element / per-component tokens are admitted only as a **defaulted override** where a real need appears, never wholesale — a small role set re-themes coherently (change `accent.violet` once, every violet element moves) and keeps the deferred system's floor-validation tractable (~20 tokens, not hundreds).
- **Deferred to its own initiative:** a **user-overridable theme system** (external theme file e.g. `~/.config/portal/theme.{json,toml}`, merge-over-default, validation when a user picks unreadable colours — contrast floor becomes advisory + warn/clamp — multiple built-in themes, a `theme` setting, docs). This is also where the **"use terminal background" transparency opt-out** lives (respect-terminal + advisory-floor already belong to that system). Bigger surface; ships independently after the redesign. (See §16.)

### 2.9 MV token table (closed vocabulary — pinned values)

Modern Vivid is a **closed set of ~20 named tokens** (Tokyo Night family). Every renderer references a token — **no literal hex at call sites** (this is what makes §2.8 theming work). **Dark variants are pinned exactly**, reconciled to clear the contrast floor against the **dark canvas `#0b0c14`**. **Light variants** are derived from the Tokyo Night Day siblings, contrast-verified against the **light canvas `#e1e2e7`**, with surface tints **pinned and eyeballed at the in-terminal validation gate (§15)**.

**Greys / text ramp**

| Token | Role | Dark (on `#0b0c14`) | Light (on `#e1e2e7`) | Floor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `text.primary` | names, wordmark, active labels, modal titles, chip text | `#C0CAF5` · 13.0 | `#2E3C64` · 8.3 | 4.5 |
| `text.strong` | selected-row meta, help actions | `#A9B1D6` · 9.9 | `#3F4760` · 7.1 | 4.5 |
| `text.muted-bright` | done-tick labels, selected-row path | `#828BB8` · 6.3 | `#4C5478` · 5.7 | 4.5 |
| `text.detail` | paths, counts, footer labels, subtitles, group headings | `#737AA2` · 5.0 | `#586093` · 4.6 | 4.5 |
| `text.dim` | group `··· N` counts, pending loading steps | `#535C86` · 3.2 | `#767DA2` · 3.1 | 3.0¹ |
| `text.faint` | decorative only — inactive dots, `+ add`, mode indicator, hints | `#3B4261` | `#AEB2C6` | exempt² |
| `text.on-selection` | name on the selected row | `#FFFFFF` | `#1A1B2E` | 4.5 |

¹ Held to the 3:1 large/UI floor — deliberately de-emphasised but legible. ² Decorative-only; **must never carry functional text** (2.1:1, exempt from the floor).

**Accents**

| Token | Role | Dark | Light | Floor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `accent.violet` | selector `▌`, active dot, `?` key, focused field outline + label, mode bar, loading bar | `#BB9AF7` · 9.1 | `#8A3FD1` · 4.4 | 3.0 |
| `accent.blue` | footer / modal **key-hint glyphs** | `#7AA2F7` · 8.3 | `#2D5CCA` · 4.6 | 4.5 |
| `accent.cyan` | Sessions header, Preview chrome, active tick `◐` | `#7DCFFF` · 12.2 | `#0D6C87` · 4.6 | 4.5 |
| `state.green` | `● attached`, Sessions count, Projects label, `✓` done, success flash | `#9ECE6A` · 11.5 | `#3B5E18` · 5.8 | 4.5 |
| `state.red` | kill/delete emphasis, `▲` | `#F7768E` · 7.9 | `#BD2545` · 4.6 | 4.5 |
| `accent.orange` | filter query / `/` / `type`, editing border + text cursor + `◉ EDIT MODE`, warning flash `⚠` | `#FF9E64` · 10.3 | `#9A5200` · 4.5 | 4.5 |

**Surfaces (tints / borders — light values finalised at validation)**

| Token | Role | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|---|
| `canvas` | owned mode-matched canvas (painted on every cell) | `#0b0c14` | `#e1e2e7` |
| `bg.selection` | selected-row tint | `#28243a` | `#D0C6F0` |
| `bg.warning` | warning-flash band | `#241B10` | `#E8D6A8` |
| `bg.track` | loading-bar empty track | `#26283A` | `#D2D4DE` |
| `border.separator` | title rule (2px) | `#292E42` | `#C9CDDB` |
| `border.footer` | footer rule (1px) | `#20232E` | `#C9CDDB` |
| `text.on-warning` | warning-flash message | `#E8C9A0` · 13.3 | `#7A4B12` · 5.1 |

**Rules**
- **Closed vocabulary** — every rendered colour is one of these tokens; no literal hex outside the token layer (enforces §2.8 theme-readiness).
- `state.green` carries **live / positive** signals (attached marker, Sessions count, Projects label, `✓` done-tick, success flash) — **never** chips or decoration; `state.red` is **destructive-only**; chips are `text.primary` on a tint, never green.
- **One documented exception:** the **Preview scrollback capture** renders the pane's **real ANSI output**, not theme tokens — intentionally outside the palette. Only its *chrome* (frame, top bar) is themed (`accent.cyan` + `text.detail`).
- **Contrast re-verification (the canvas pass).** Every foreground token, every per-element tint/band, and every foreground-on-tint pairing is verified against the **exact canvas** — dark variants vs `#0b0c14`, light variants vs `#e1e2e7`. The two variants resolve **independently** (each only against its own mode-canvas; no single value need hold on both). Remedy when one dips under floor: **adjust toward more contrast** — *brighten* a dark variant on `#0b0c14`, *darken / saturate* a light variant on `#e1e2e7` — never drop the floor.
- **Text-carrying tints are co-tuned with their on-band text token.** A tint that carries text (the selection band, notice bands) is pinned by **two** ratios — tint-vs-canvas (≥3:1 UI floor) and text-vs-tint (≥4.5/3:1 text floor) — and **both must clear simultaneously**. There are two knobs (the tint *and* its on-band text token); when no single tint value satisfies both, the text token moves too. The spec measures the **pair**, not the tint alone.
- **No stray hex.** The mockups' ad-hoc values collapse to tokens: `#15131F` → `bg.selection`, `#2B3050` → `border.separator`. No raw hex survives outside this table.
- **Light surface tints finalised at §15.** `bg.selection` (`#D0C6F0`), `bg.warning` (`#E8D6A8`), `bg.track` (`#D2D4DE`), and the light borders (`#C9CDDB`) are **pinned and eyeballed** against `#e1e2e7` at the validation gate, each **derived from its dark anchor + the surface it renders** — not invented. A numeric pass alone is insufficient; the light-tint-on-light-canvas case is the recurring risk.
- All values are a **hypothesis until prototyped in a real terminal (§15)**; the table is the build target, validation is the lock.

## 3. Visual Identity (shared chrome)

These elements form the shared frame around every page (Sessions, Projects, Preview, Loading); per-page specifics are in §4–§10. Measurements are the Paper-frame reference values — exact cell mapping is finalised at implementation (terminal cells, not web px).

> **Reference (Paper):** the shared chrome is exemplified by `Sessions — Modern Vivid v2` (dark) and `Sessions — Modern Vivid (Light)`.

### 3.1 Header — wordmark + caret + subtitle + rule
- **Wordmark:** `PORTAL` in **uppercase, letter-spaced** (≈0.26em), heavy weight, `text.primary`. Decorative — exempt from the text-contrast ratio but must stay visible.
- **Caret:** a solid block `▌` in `accent.violet`, immediately right of the wordmark — the one retained retro flourish.
- **Subtitle:** right-aligned `session manager` in `text.detail`, small + letter-spaced.
- **Separator rule:** a full-width **2px** rule (`border.separator`) under the header, dividing it from the body.
- **Narrow degrade:** below the minimum width the wordmark collapses to a compact form and the subtitle drops (per §2.7).

### 3.2 Section header
Directly under the rule: a **page/mode label** + **count** on the left, an optional hint on the right.
- Label in `accent.cyan` (Sessions) or `state.green` (Projects); a mode suffix (`— by project` / `— by tag`) in `text.detail`.
- The count renders at the **same font size** as the label, distinguished by **dim colour** not by being smaller (shares the baseline/cap-height): `state.green` for the Sessions count, `text.detail` for the Projects count.
- Right side carries the persistent `/ to filter` hint (`text.detail`) on every filterable view; `s switch view` lives in the footer only (never duplicated here).

### 3.3 Selection — thick violet left-bar
The selected row is marked by a **thick block `▌` in `accent.violet`** pinned at the far-left (a full 2-cell column), over a subtle **`bg.selection`** row tint; the selected name renders in `text.on-selection`. Unselected rows have no bar and no tint. This is the single, consistent selection signal across Sessions, grouped views, and Projects (Projects uses a full-height bar spanning its two-line row — §6).

### 3.4 Footer — condensed keymap + `?` help
A single bottom row above a **1px** top rule (`border.footer`):
- Shows the page's **core** keys — for Sessions exactly: `↑↓ navigate · ⏎ attach · / filter · ␣ preview · s switch view · x projects` plus a right-aligned `? help`. `n` new, `r` rename, `k` kill, `q` quit, and paging are **not** in the footer — they live in `?` help (§8.5). `s switch view` and `x projects` appear on **all** session views (Flat included). The full keymap — including the footer's own keys — is always listed in `?` help (§8.5).
- **Key glyphs** render in `accent.blue`, their **labels** in `text.detail`, the `?` glyph in `accent.violet`.
- The **full** keymap lives in the `?` help modal (§8), per page. This solves the footer-space problem (the old three-column footer couldn't fit every bind).

### 3.5 Pagination
`bubbles/list`'s built-in height-driven paginator renders as **centred dots** above the footer: the active page dot in `accent.violet`, inactive dots in `text.faint`.

### 3.6 Borders & framing
**No full-screen frame.** Structure is carried by the two horizontal rules (header separator, footer rule) plus per-element treatments (selection tint, modal panels, preview chrome) — never a box around the whole UI. The owned canvas (§1) is a flat full-terminal **fill**, not a frame: it paints every cell the same `canvas` colour but draws no border around the UI.

---

## 4. Sessions — Flat list

The default Sessions view (mode **Flat**) and the baseline every other view derives from. `s` cycles Flat → by Project → by Tag (§5); the active mode shows in the section header.

> **Reference (Paper):** `Sessions — Modern Vivid v2`.

### 4.1 Row anatomy
Each session is **one delegate line** — the load-bearing pagination invariant (every list row is exactly one line). Layout:
- **Name** — full-width **left column (flex)**, `text.primary` (selected: `text.on-selection` over the `bg.selection` tint + violet bar). Names are `{project}-{nanoid}` or arbitrary renamed strings (variable length, may contain spaces); over-long names **truncate with `…`** (§2.7). The flat row shows **name only** — no project/path column (that dimension is served by the grouping modes, §5).
- **Window count** — a **fixed-width trailing slot**, left-aligned, `text.detail` (selected row: `text.strong`). Reads `N window` / `N windows`.
- **Attached marker** — a **fixed-width trailing slot** right of the count: `● attached` in `state.green` when attached; an **empty slot of the same width** when not — so the bullets line up vertically down the list and the counts stay column-aligned. On the **selected** row the `● attached` marker **keeps `state.green`** (the attached-only rule holds; green-on-`bg.selection` clears the floor). The selection/warning tints must keep every selected-row foreground — name, count, attached bullet — above the floor; these are verified **against the tints** in addition to the §2.3 canvas gate (the foreground-on-tint pairings of §2.9).

Trailing slots are fixed-width and right-pinned; the name flexes to fill the remainder. This keeps the `● attached` bullets and the window counts each vertically aligned regardless of name length.

### 4.2 Section header & count
`Sessions` (`accent.cyan`) + count (`state.green`) on the left; the `/ to filter` hint on the right (§3.2). An empty list shows the empty state (§11.1).

### 4.3 Selection & navigation
A single violet left-bar + tint marks the cursor row (§3.3). The cursor never lands on a header/non-row; navigation is arrows + `Ctrl+↑/↓` page (§12). Selection feeds `⏎ attach` and `␣ preview`.

---

## 5. Sessions — Grouped views (by Project / by Tag)

> **Existing behaviour — preserved (reskin).** The grouping *machinery* — the `s` cycle, the `HeaderItem` model, Pattern A/B, the catch-alls, cursor-skip, directory resolution, tag anchoring, and mode persistence — is **already implemented**. The only change here is the **MV visual treatment** of headings and rows (§5.1); §5.2–§5.5 record the existing logic the styling consumes, as constraints to preserve — not to rebuild.
>
> **Reference (Paper):** `Sessions — by Project (MV)` · `Sessions — by Tag (MV)`.

`s` cycles the Sessions page through three **views of the same data**: Flat → **by Project** → **by Tag** → Flat. The cycle is **unconditional** (always includes by Tag, even with zero tags or zero sessions). The active view shows in the section header (`Sessions — by project` / `— by tag`); the footer adds an `s switch view` hint. Pressing `s` resets the paginator to page 1. The last-used view **persists** in `prefs.json` (best-effort; failure non-fatal). While the `/` filter is focused, `s` is a literal filter character.

### 5.1 Render-layer grouping (the key invariant)
Group headings are **real, non-selectable rows** (`HeaderItem`) interleaved before each group's session rows — **every list row, header or session, is exactly one delegate line**, so `bubbles/list` pagination stays exact (a page can never draw more lines than the viewport). Grouping is pure Lipgloss styling in the existing delegate — **not** routed through `lipgloss/tree`.
- **Heading row:** `heading ··· N` — the heading in `text.detail`, the `··· N` count in `text.dim` (dimmer). Non-selectable: its filter value is empty, so headings **vanish the instant a filter query is typed** (flatten-on-filter for free).
- **Session rows** nest **one indent level further** than flat (cursor at col 2, name at col 4); flat rows sit flush at col 2.
- The **cursor skips header rows** on initial selection and on every navigation (arrows, paging, and crossing a group boundary) — it only ever lands on session rows.

### 5.2 By Project (Pattern A)
**One row per session**, grouped under its **project**. Key = the session's directory reduced to a canonical path. Sessions whose directory resolves to no known project collect under a pinned **Unknown** catch-all (counted, empty-suppressed, with its own heading).

### 5.3 By Tag (Pattern B)
**One row per `(session, tag)` pair** — a session with multiple tags **repeats** under each tag's heading. Untagged sessions collect under a pinned **Untagged** catch-all. If **no project anywhere has tags**, the view shows the **"No tags yet" signpost** over the flat list instead (degrade-with-message, not silent flatten — §11.3).

### 5.4 Session → directory resolution
Each live session maps to a directory via the **`@portal-dir`** session user-option, stamped at creation from the git-root (by both normal creation and QuickStart), so a session stays anchored to its origin project even after its panes `cd` away.
- **Legacy fallback:** for sessions created before the stamp shipped (no `@portal-dir`), the grouped render derives the directory from the **active pane's `current_path` → git-root**, uses it for this render, and **caches the guess in-memory only** (later rebuilds in the same picker skip the pane read). It is **never stamped back to tmux** (a pane's cwd can drift; freezing it would mis-group the session permanently) — it re-derives next launch, so a session that has `cd`'d back self-corrects.
- The lookup key and the stored project path are both reduced via the same canonical-path function.
- **Pane reads are gated to grouped modes only** — Flat and the zero-tags signpost perform **zero** pane reads.

### 5.5 Tags are directory-anchored (v1)
Tags live on the **project record** (not per session). A session's effective tags = its directory's tags, looked up **live at grouped-render time**. Tags are managed only in the projects edit modal (§8) — never per session, no CLI. (Deferred: per-session tags, live-grouped filtering, tag exclusion — §16.)

---

## 6. Projects page

> **Existing behaviour — preserved (reskin).** The Projects page, its keymap, and project CRUD already exist; this section restyles them in MV. Behaviour stays identical.
>
> **Reference (Paper):** `Projects (MV)`.

A **separate page** (different data + keymap), reached by `x` from Sessions; `x` returns. Same shared chrome (§3): PORTAL header + separator, pagination, condensed footer.

### 6.1 Section header
`Projects` (`state.green`) + count (`text.detail`) on the left; the `/ to filter` hint on the right.

### 6.2 Two-line rows
Each project is a **two-line row** (uniform height, so `bubbles/list` height-driven pagination stays exact):
- **Line 1 — name** in `text.primary` (heavy).
- **Line 2 — path** in `text.detail` (dim).
- **Selected:** a **full-height `accent.violet` left bar** (a column of coloured cells spanning **both** lines) + `bg.selection` tint; the name becomes `text.on-selection`, the path `text.muted-bright`.

An empty list shows the empty projects state (§11.1).

### 6.3 Footer (project keymap)
Condensed: `⏎ new session · x sessions · e edit · / filter · ? help`. The **full** set — `d delete`, `n new in cwd`, navigation — lives in the per-page `?` help modal (§8).

---

## 7. Filtering (`/`)

> **Existing behaviour — preserved (reskin).** Live filtering is `bubbles/list`'s built-in filter; this section restyles the query in MV and **pins the two-mode boundary** so the state machine is unambiguous. The styling + boundary clarity is the change — the filter engine is unchanged.
>
> **Reference (Paper):** `Filtering — input active (MV)` · `Filtering — list-active (MV)` · `Filtering — no matches (MV)`.

`/` opens an **inline filter input** in the section-header row (where the `/ to filter` hint sits). The query renders in **`accent.orange`** (with an `accent.orange` `/` prefix); the list filters **live as you type**. The `/ to filter` hint shows top-right **consistently** on every session view (Flat / by Project / by Tag) and Projects. **No match-count is shown** — the visible results suffice. Typing a query flattens grouped views (headings vanish — §5.1).

### 7.1 Two mutually-exclusive modes
Filtering is **never both at once** — there is never an active input cursor *and* a selected row simultaneously:

1. **Input-active (typing).** Keystrokes go to the query; the **cursor sits at the end of the typed text**; the list updates live; **no list row is selected**. Filter bar reads `/ <query>▌`; footer: `type to filter · ↵/↓ browse results · esc clear`.
2. **List-active (browsing results).** The input row stays visible — the **locked `accent.orange` query (no cursor)** is what signals the list is filtered; **arrows move the selection**; `↵` attaches; `Esc` clears and returns. No background tint. Footer: `↵ attach · ↑↓ navigate · esc clear filter`.

### 7.2 Boundary
- **`↵` or `↓`** commits input-active → list-active.
- **`Esc`** clears the filter from either mode (returns to the unfiltered list).

### 7.3 Over-filtered (no matches)
When the query matches nothing: a centred empty state — a dim `∅` glyph (`text.faint`), `No sessions match "<query>"` (`text.primary`), hint `⌫ to widen the search · esc to clear the filter` (`text.detail`). Footer stays in input-active form.

---

## 8. Modals (edit · kill · rename · help)

> **Reference (Paper):** `Edit Modal — navigate (name)` · `Edit Modal — chip focused` · `Edit Modal — edit in place` · `Kill Confirm Modal (MV)` · `Rename Modal (MV)` · `Sessions — Help Modal (?)`.

### 8.1 Modal framing (shared)
- **Modals render on a blank screen (changed behaviour).** When a modal opens, the page behind is **cleared to the owned canvas** (mode-matched — §1, not a literal black) and the modal is centred on it. **This changes today's behaviour** — existing modals render **as an overlay on top of the page content**. Blank-screen is therefore a **shared modal-layer change**, not a per-modal restyle.
  - **Open implementation question (feasibility-gated, §14):** whether the existing modal render path can be **adapted** (clear/replace the page, then draw the centred modal — likely small) or needs a **modal-system rework** is **not yet determined** — assess against the code at implementation. Either way, the underlying **confirm / input logic of each modal must be preserved** (parity); only the surrounding render shell changes.
  - *(Exception: the Preview screen is a full-screen overlay, not a modal — §9; a `?` help opened from Preview overlays the preview without blanking it.)*
- Centred **border-defined panel** — **no distinct fill**; it sits directly on the canvas, defined by its **2-tone border** (`border.separator` + `border.footer`) and its header/footer dividers, **not** a `bg.surface` token (there is none) — with a **contextual footer** reflecting the modal's current focus/mode. Inputs likewise stay **border-defined** with a transparent fill (no recessed-input token).
- **Shared anatomy.** Every modal = a **header row** (title left; right-corner **empty except `◉ EDIT MODE` while editing in place** — no standing "navigate" label) over the body over a **contextual footer**. The title is `text.primary`, except **destructive modals (kill, delete) render the title + `▲` in `state.red`**. The **dismiss key always lives in the footer** (never the header) as `esc <verb>` — `esc cancel` (kill / delete / rename), `esc close` (edit navigate / chip), `esc discard` (edit-in-place); the verbs differ by semantics, never the wording (no "esc *to* cancel"). *(Exception: the read-only `?` help modal (§8.5) is a reference panel — its body **is** the keymap, so it carries its dismiss hint in the header right-corner as `esc close` (still no "to") and has no contextual footer.)*
- **Modals are key-exclusive while open** — an open modal consumes all key input until dismissed; underlying page binds (`s`/`x`/`n`/`e`/`d`/clear-filter/quit, etc.) do **not** fire beneath it. `Esc` resolves against the modal first.
- Reskin status: **kill**, **rename**, and **delete-project** keep their **confirm/rename logic** (parity) but adopt the new blank-screen rendering + MV restyle; the **edit modal** adopts a **new interaction model** (§8.2); the **`?` help modal** is **new** (§8.5).

### 8.2 Edit Project modal — two-mode, immediate-persist (⚠ behaviour change)
> **New behaviour (not a reskin-preserve).** This replaces the current asymmetric model (tags persist live; Name/Aliases batch) with a **uniform two-mode immediate-persist** model across all three fields. Behaviour parity does **not** apply here — it is a deliberate change; implement as specified.

A bordered panel with labelled fields **NAME / ALIASES / TAGS** and a header (`Edit Project <name>`; the right-corner shows `◉ EDIT MODE` **only while editing in place**, empty otherwise — no standing "navigate" label). Two modes apply uniformly to all three fields:

- **Navigate mode (default).** `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` **(or `↑`/`↓`)** move between fields; `←/→` move across chips and the trailing `+ add` slot within a chip field. **Entering a chip field via `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`/`↑`/`↓` lands on the trailing `+ add` slot** (adding is the common action); `←` then reaches the existing chips. The focused element shows a **focus highlight** (`accent.violet` outline, no fill). `x` **deletes** a focused chip immediately. `Esc` **closes the modal**.
- **Edit mode (one element live).** Entered by `Enter`/`e` on a chip, `Enter` on Name, or `Enter`/`+` on a focused `+ add` slot — which **spawns a new empty chip already in edit mode** (edit highlight + live cursor). Landing on `+ add` (via `Tab` or `←/→`) is navigate-mode focus only; it never auto-enters edit mode. Type to edit; `←/→` move the **text cursor within the value**. `Enter` **commits & persists** → back to navigate; `Esc` **discards that element's edit** (a brand-new empty chip vanishes) → back to navigate.

**Persistence is immediate, per item** — each element persists on exit-edit (`Enter`). There is **no dirty state, no save key, no batch**; `Esc` never discards saved work (it only backs out the current edit, or closes the already-saved modal). This extends the codebase's existing tags-persist-live behaviour to Name + Aliases (consistent, not a reversal).

**Falling-out rules:**
- **Empty on commit = delete** (new or existing chip); deleting a focused chip is immediate.
- **Empty Name can't persist → reverts** to the prior value.
- **Duplicate on commit = no-op.** Committing a chip whose value already exists in the same field silently dedupes (the existing chip remains; no duplicate is added, no error shown) — consistent with the project store's existing per-field dedupe (tags are case-sensitive).
- **`Esc` backs out one level:** edit mode → discard the element's edit; navigate mode → close (all already saved).

**Visual states (the focus-vs-edit grammar, §13):**
- **Chips** (aliases AND tags) are a **bordered box, never filled** (a glyph border can't coexist with a fill) with **square corners** (the input's rounded corners are the differentiator); text is `text.primary`, **never green** (green is attached-only). Three states **by border colour**: **normal** (`border.separator` grey, no `✕`) · **focused** (`accent.violet` border, no `✕` — `x` removes it; the footer carries `x remove`) · **editing** (`accent.orange` border + live cursor, no `✕`).
- **Field labels:** the **focused field's** label is `accent.violet`; the others are `text.detail`.
- **`+ add`** is an inline input slot (not a button/popup) in `text.faint`; the **mode indicator** reads `◉ EDIT MODE` (`accent.orange`) while editing, absent in navigate.

**Contextual footer** (matches focus/mode):
- Name focused (navigate): `↵/e edit · ⇥ next field · esc close`.
- Chip focused (navigate): `↵/e edit · x remove · ←→ move · ⇥ next field · esc close`.
- Editing in place: `↵ save · esc discard · ←→ cursor · empty on save = delete`.

The modal stays a **single bundle** for Name + Aliases + Tags (not split).

### 8.3 Kill confirm modal
> **Confirm logic preserved; rendering + keymap changed.** The confirm action is unchanged, but the keymap drops `n` (cancel is `Esc` only — §8.1 anatomy); it also inherits the new blank-screen rendering (§8.1) and the MV restyle.

A centred panel with a **`state.red` header** `▲ Kill session?`, the **session name in `state.red`**, `· N window(s)` (`text.detail`), a consequence line "Ends the tmux session and all its panes. Can't be undone." (`text.detail`), footer `y kill · esc cancel`. **`state.red` is reserved for destructive actions.** Keys: `y` (confirm) / `Esc` (cancel).

### 8.4 Rename modal
> **Logic preserved; rendering changed.** The rename flow is unchanged (parity); it inherits the new blank-screen rendering (§8.1) and the MV restyle.

A header `Rename session` (`text.primary`), a labelled `NEW NAME` input. The input is a single **always-focused, always-editing** field, so it renders an **`accent.orange` border + `▌` cursor** (per the §13.1 grammar) with an **`accent.orange` `◉ EDIT MODE`** badge in the header right-corner; the focused label is `accent.violet`, the value `text.primary`. A `was: <old name>` context line (`text.detail`), footer `↵ rename · esc cancel`. Keys: `Enter`/`Esc`. *(The orange always-editing treatment is applied by task 3-10, which routes the rename input through the shared §13.1 input-box helper.)*

### 8.5 `?` help modal (new) — per-page
> **New behaviour.** There is **no `?` binding today** (`?` is actively swallowed so `bubbles/list` doesn't toggle its own help). This adds: **bind `?`** on every page + a help-modal type + **per-page content**.

A centred panel listing **the current page's** keymap (two columns: key-hint glyph in `accent.blue` / action label in `text.strong`), header `? Keybindings` (`text.primary`), right-aligned `esc close` (`text.detail`) — the documented help-modal exception to §8.1. The help modal lists the page's **complete** keymap — **including the keys also shown in the footer** (it is the full reference, not just the footer's overflow). Content differs per page (Sessions / Projects / Preview keymaps — §12); only Sessions help is mocked, the others follow their audited keymaps at implementation. **Content source:** the help modal is **generated from the page's keymap descriptor** — the single source of truth that also drives the footer and §12.1 — not hand-authored per page. A binding change updates the footer and help together, and the Projects/Preview help modals are produced from their audited keymaps with no separate copy to author. Opened from Preview, it **overlays** the preview (doesn't blank it — §9). The help modal closes on `?` (toggle) or `Esc`; while open it is key-exclusive (§8.1), so `Esc` dismisses it and does **not** fall through to the page's clear-filter / quit.

### 8.6 Delete project confirm modal
> **Confirm logic preserved; rendering + keymap changed.** The confirm action is unchanged, but the keymap drops `n` (cancel is `Esc` only — §8.1 anatomy); it also inherits the blank-screen rendering (§8.1) + MV restyle. *(Mocked at implementation, mirroring `Kill Confirm Modal (MV)`.)*

A centred panel mirroring the kill modal's destructive treatment: a **`state.red` header** `▲ Delete project?`, the **project name in `state.red`**, its path (`text.detail`), and a consequence line that disambiguates it from killing a session — it removes only the **project record**: "Removes this project from Portal (name, aliases, tags). Your sessions and files are untouched." (`text.detail`). Footer `y delete · esc cancel`. Keys: `y` (confirm) / `Esc` (cancel).

---

## 9. Preview screen

> **Existing behaviour — preserved (reskin).** The read-only scrollback preview already exists (`pagepreview.go`, hand-composed chrome); this restyles its chrome to the MV cyan "peek mode". The captured content and scroll/nav behaviour are unchanged.
>
> **Reference (Paper):** `Preview Screen (MV)`.

A **full-screen overlay** (not a modal — the blank-screen rule of §8.1 does not apply), reached by `Space` on a session. Its chrome is **`accent.cyan`-framed** to signal **"peek mode"** — deliberately distinct from the violet main UI, preserving the `preview-visual-distinction` mode-signal in the MV palette.

### 9.1 Chrome
The preview is a **full-screen joined panel** — the same hand-drawn rounded panel shape as the modals (`renderJoinedPanel`), but **single-tone `accent.cyan`**: the border AND the header/footer dividers all render in `accent.cyan`, joined to the sides via `├`/`┤`, rounded corners, **no fill** in any compartment (a glyph border can't carry a fill — §13.1). Three compartments:
- **Header:** `◉ preview` (`accent.cyan`) + `<session>` (`text.primary`) + `Window x/y · Pane x/y` (`text.detail`).
- **Body:** the read-only captured content (§9.2), inset from the border.
- **Footer:** the nav hints — key glyph in `accent.blue` + label in `text.detail`, **space-separated** (the shared footer convention, no middots): `←→ window  ⇥ pane  ⏎ attach  ␣ back`.

### 9.2 Captured content (out-of-theme)
The pane content is the **real captured ANSI output**, rendered read-only — **not** theme tokens (the documented palette exception, §2.9/§15.1). Only the chrome is themed; the content is whatever the pane actually printed. On the owned canvas, the `canvas` colour paints the preview **chrome** (cyan frame + top bar) and surrounding margins; the **content area is left as the untouched real ANSI** — a captured pane with no background of its own shows the canvas behind it, one with its own ANSI background shows that. The cyan chrome's contrast against the canvas is covered by the §2.9 re-verification pass.

### 9.3 Keys & overlays
Scroll `↑↓` + `Ctrl+↑/↓`; **`←`/`→` window** (prev/next); **`Tab` pane** (next, cycle); `⏎` attach (this pane); `Space`/`Esc` back (§12). A `?` help opened here **overlays** the preview (doesn't blank it — §8.1). *(Pane uses `Tab` rather than `Ctrl+←/→` — the latter is bound to macOS Mission Control Spaces switching.)*

## 10. Loading interstitial & cold-path startup flip

> **New engineering — the single biggest item in the redesign (its own phase/PR).** Making the loading screen honest/determinate requires restructuring cold-boot bootstrap to run concurrently with the TUI. Gated behind in-terminal validation of the visual direction (§15). Estimated **~1–1.5 days** incl. tests + race review — treat the estimate as having genuine variance given the load-bearing startup path and its prior-incident history (the slow-open / zombie-session episode).
>
> **Reference (Paper):** `Loading 6 — Combined (thick bar)`. *(The loading-page error frame is mocked at implementation — §10.5.)*

### 10.1 Cold vs warm — when the loading screen shows
The loading page is gated on **`serverStarted`** (set only when `EnsureServer` actually had to start the tmux server):
- **Cold boot** (no tmux server): server started → full bootstrap → **loading page shown**.
- **Warm** (server already up, just opening another picker): `serverStarted=false` → bootstrap steps no-op → **straight to the picker, no loading page**. The common case — instant and **untouched**.

**The flip is scoped to the COLD path only.** A cheap `tmux has-server` check decides; warm keeps today's fast synchronous path, carrying **zero new risk**.

### 10.2 The startup flip (concurrent cold-boot bootstrap)
**Today:** the full 11-step bootstrap runs **synchronously in `PersistentPreRunE` before the TUI launches** — by the time the loading page renders, restore is already 100 % done, so the page is a cosmetic 1.2 s pad. A slow restore happens *before* the page appears (frozen terminal).

**Flip:** for the **cold + TUI path only** (scoped via the existing `isTUIPath`; CLI/direct-path keeps the synchronous bootstrap), launch Bubble Tea **immediately** on the loading page, run the orchestrator in a **goroutine**, stream a `tea.Msg` per real step (and per restored session), transition to Sessions on complete, **quit-with-error** on the one fatal step. A progress callback is injected at the restore per-session loop.
- The loading page already gates Sessions enumeration on `BootstrapCompleteMsg`, and the TUI is **inert during loading** (animation only) — this **contains the race surface**.
- **A progress channel carries `serverStarted` + per-step progress to the TUI** on the cold/TUI path, replacing today's `context` + package-memo delivery.
- **Canvas-flip avoidance:** the first real paint gates on **light/dark detection-or-timeout** (§2.6), so the loading page paints the correct canvas from frame one; the tens-of-ms detection is invisible against the multi-hundred-ms bootstrap, and "launch immediately" still holds.

**Real costs / risks (not zero):** reworking `serverStarted`/warnings delivery; fatal-error-as-`tea.Quit` (today a `PersistentPreRunE` error return); careful restore/daemon race review against the live event loop (prior-incident history); integration-test updates around startup ordering.

**Payoff:** an *honest* determinate loading screen **and** elimination of "frozen terminal on a slow boot" (instant "Portal is starting" feedback).

### 10.3 Loading screen design (combined, honest)
Centred **`PORTAL ▌`** (wordmark `text.primary` + caret `accent.violet`) over a **thick block progress bar** (filled `accent.violet`, track `bg.track`) and a **tick-list that ticks off** as each boot step completes — a **real list**, not an in-place text swap:
- `✓` done — glyph `state.green`, label `text.muted-bright`
- `◐` active — glyph `accent.cyan`, label `text.primary`
- `·` pending — glyph `text.faint`, label `text.dim`

Bar weight is **thick** (decided). Warm path shows no loading screen.

### 10.4 Step mapping (11 real steps → 5 friendly labels)
The bar advances on **every real bootstrap step**; the **active label** is the friendly group the current step falls in (each label spans ≥1 real step). Proposed grouping (cleanup steps 8–11 are near-instant and fold under the final label; implementation may adjust which fast step sits under which label):

| Friendly label | Real bootstrap step(s) |
|---|---|
| `Started tmux server` | 1 EnsureServer |
| `Registered hooks` | 2 RegisterPortalHooks · 3 set `@portal-restoring` · 4 SweepOrphanDaemons · 5 EnsureSaver |
| `Restoring sessions (N/M)` | 6 Restore — skeleton phase (the per-session loop; `N/M` is its real counter) |
| `Replaying scrollback` | 6 Restore — geometry + scrollback replay · 7 EagerSignalHydrate |
| `Running resume commands` | hydrate helpers firing the registered on-resume commands · 8 clear `@portal-restoring` · 9–11 marker/FIFO/stale cleanup |

Only `Restoring sessions` carries an `N/M` counter (the restore loop is the one real per-item progress source); other labels tick once.

**Empty restore (M=0 — first run / nothing saved):** the `Restoring sessions` label **suppresses the `(N/M)` counter** (renders without it) and ticks `✓` immediately; `Running resume commands` likewise ticks `✓` with no per-item work. The bar still advances through every real step — a label whose steps completed with zero items is "done," not stalled.

### 10.5 Error & warning contract (cold-path)
- **Fatal cold-boot step failure** → an **in-TUI error state on the loading page**: the failed step gets a **`state.red` marker + a one-line message**; `q`/`Esc` quits with a **non-zero exit** — rather than dropping into a half-restored picker. The loading-page **error frame** is mocked at implementation.
- **Soft warnings** ride the **progress channel** and surface as a **post-load notice** (after the picker appears).

## 11. Edge / UX states

> **Reference (Paper):** `Sessions — empty (MV)` · `Sessions — inline flash (MV)` · `Sessions — no tags signpost (MV)` · `Projects — command pending (MV)`.

**Shared convention — left-bar accent notices.** Inline notices use a **`▌` left-bar accent line**: **`accent.orange`** = transient / warning, **`state.green`** = transient / success, **`accent.violet`** = mode / info. **Placement:** the band sits **directly under the title separator, above the section header** (full-width); the section header + list **shift down**.

**Single-slot rule.** The notice slot holds **at most one band**. Persistent mode notices (no-tags signpost §11.3, command-pending banner §11.4) own the slot while their mode is active; a transient flash (§11.2) **takes the slot temporarily**, replacing any persistent band for its duration, then the persistent band returns. The flash **auto-clears on the next keypress or after a short timeout**. A persistent (violet info) band and a transient flash (orange warning or green success) never display at once — the transient flash wins while shown.

### 11.1 Empty states (reskin)
- **Empty sessions** — centred: a dim block glyph `▌ ▌ ▌` (`text.faint`), `No sessions yet` (`text.primary`), hint `Press n to start one in the current directory · x for projects` (`text.detail`); the footer is **replaced** by the keys relevant with no sessions — `n new in cwd · x projects · / filter · ? help` (drawn from the page's full keymap §12.1, not a subset of the standard footer).
- **Empty projects** mirrors it — `No projects yet` + an open-a-directory hint (same pattern; not separately mocked).

### 11.2 Inline flash (chrome band)
A **transient band** under the title separator: an **`accent.orange` left-bar** + `⚠` + message (e.g. `folio-Jiz4el closed externally — list updated`), on a `bg.warning` tint with `text.on-warning` message text; **auto-clears**. The **success variant** uses `state.green` with a `✓` glyph (so success stays glyph-distinct from the warning `⚠`, not colour-only — §2.2, matching the §2.9 `state.green` role).
- **F10 — flash vs pagination:** the flash band is **chrome** — when it appears/clears, the list **viewport height is recomputed** (the same recompute the one-row-per-delegate invariant already mandates), so the list never overflows or miscounts rows.

### 11.3 "No tags yet" signpost (reskin)
By-Tag with **zero tags anywhere**: an **`accent.violet` left-bar** signpost (`No tags yet — add tags in a project's editor: press x for projects, then e to edit`, `text.on-selection` — the on-band token co-tuned for the `bg.selection` info-band tint, matching the §11.4 command-pending banner so all persistent info bands read consistently) over the **flat list** — degrade-with-message, not a silent flatten (§5.3).

### 11.4 Command-pending banner (reskin)
When Projects is invoked to **run a command**: an **`accent.violet` left-bar** banner (`Pick a project to run`) with the command in an **`accent.orange` chip**; the footer becomes `⏎ run here · n run in cwd · esc cancel`. The screen keeps the **full Projects chrome** (green `Projects` header + `/ to filter`) — not a stripped page; the banner sits on top.

---

## 12. Keybindings (audited against code)

> **Mixed: mostly existing bindings, with a deliberate keymap revision.** The per-screen keymaps below are audited against the current code. The **changes** are: drop all vim/extra nav aliases, repurpose `k`, and add the `?` binding (§12.2). Unchanged bindings are preserved (parity).

### 12.1 Per-screen keymaps
- **Sessions (flat & grouped):** `↑`/`↓` move · `Ctrl+↑`/`Ctrl+↓` page · `/` filter · `Enter` attach · `Space` preview · `s` cycle grouping (flat→project→tag) · `r` rename · `k` kill · `n` new-in-cwd · `x` → Projects · `q` quit · `Esc` clear-filter / quit. Grouping adds no keys.
- **Projects:** `↑`/`↓` move · `Ctrl+↑`/`Ctrl+↓` page · `/` filter · `Enter` new-session-from-project · `x` → Sessions · `e` edit · `d` delete · `n` new-in-cwd · `q` quit · `Esc`.
- **Preview:** `↑`/`↓` + `Ctrl+↑`/`Ctrl+↓` scroll · `Tab` next pane · `]`/`[` window · `Enter` attach (this pane) · `Space`/`Esc` back.
- **Modals:** kill `y`/`Esc` · delete-project `y`/`Esc` · rename `Enter`/`Esc` · edit — two-mode (§8.2).

### 12.2 Keymap revision (the changes)
- **Navigation is arrows only.** **Drop all vim aliases (`h`/`j`/`k`/`l`, `g`/`G`) and `PgUp`/`PgDn`/`Home`/`End`** — move is `↑`/`↓`, page is `Ctrl+↑`/`Ctrl+↓`. `/` filter is the fast-find (filtering, not jump-to-extremes, is how you find a session).
- **`k` = kill** — freed by dropping vim-up; the tmux-accurate verb, kept distinct from Projects' `d` = delete (removing a project *record* is a different operation).
- **No uppercase bindings anywhere.**
- **`?` is newly bound** on every page → opens the per-page help modal (§8.5). **Today `?` is actively swallowed** (so `bubbles/list` doesn't toggle its own help); the redesign binds it.
- **Page ⟷ view keys de-overloaded.** **`x` toggles Sessions ⟷ Projects** (both directions); **`s` is Sessions-only** (cycle views). The former `p` (Sessions → Projects) and `s` (Projects → Sessions) aliases are **dropped**, so each key has a single meaning.

### 12.3 Validation caveat
Confirm `Ctrl+↑`/`Ctrl+↓` isn't swallowed by the terminal/tmux during in-terminal validation (§15); **fall back to another page key if so.**

---

## 13. Interaction conventions (cross-cutting)

These conventions apply across surfaces; per-surface detail lives in the referenced sections.

### 13.1 Focus vs edit — visual grammar
**Nothing fills.** A glyph-drawn thin border can't coexist with a background fill (the fill overlaps the border glyphs or leaves a gap), so every editable element — inputs and chips alike — is a **bordered box** whose **state is carried by border colour**, never a fill:
- **Unfocused / normal:** `border.separator` grey (matches the modal frame).
- **Focused** (navigate): **`accent.violet`** border; the field's label follows `text.detail` → `accent.violet`. No cursor.
- **Editing** (cursor live): **`accent.orange`** border + a live cursor, plus an **`accent.orange` `◉ EDIT MODE`** indicator in the modal header.
- **So: grey = idle, violet = focused, orange = editing** — one rule for inputs and chips.

**Corners are the element-type differentiator:** **inputs render rounded**, **chips render square** (same box construction otherwise). *(The Paper frames draw both square; the rounded input is a code convention — a documented design-vs-terminal divergence.)*

**Single-input modals** (e.g. **rename**) have one always-focused, always-editing input, so it shows the **`accent.orange`** border + `◉ EDIT MODE` badge (§8.4).

**Chips** (aliases AND tags) carry no inline `✕` (removal is `x` on a focused chip; the footer carries `x remove`); **green is reserved for `attached` only, never chips** (detail in §8.2).

### 13.2 Page model — views vs pages
- **Sessions is ONE page with three grouping *views*** (Flat / by Project / by Tag), cycled by `s` — the same data pivoted, not separate pages (§4–§5).
- **Projects is a separate *page*** (different data + keymap), reached by `x` (§6).
- **Preview** is an overlay screen (`Space`, §9); **Loading** is the startup screen (§10).

### 13.3 `?` help is per-page contextual
`?` is bound on every page (not modals) and opens a help modal listing **that page's** keymap — one overlay pattern, page-specific content (§8.5, §12).

### 13.4 Filtering & the `/ to filter` hint
The `/ to filter` hint shows top-right on every session view and Projects; `s switch view` lives in the **footer**. Two-mode filtering detail in §7.

### 13.5 Modals on a blank screen
When a (centred) modal opens, the page behind is cleared to the **owned canvas** (mode-matched — §8.1), not a dimmed overlay (a change from today). The Preview overlay is the exception (§9).

### 13.6 Typography — counts beside labels
A count next to a label (`Sessions N`, `Projects N`, group `heading ··· N`) renders at the **same font size** as the label, distinguished by its **dim colour**, not by being smaller — so it shares the baseline and cap-height.

---

## 14. Implementation architecture (feasibility)

> **Context for planning — sizing, not task breakdown.** ~80 % of this reskin is restyling already-custom Lipgloss render code (today's TUI is hand-rendered on top of `bubbles/list`, not an off-the-shelf widget kit). No widget framework is needed.

### 14.1 Kept as-is (the engine)
`bubbles/list` provides the list model, pagination (the dots), filtering, cursor/selection, and nav for Sessions & Projects. The **build constraint holds**: grouping stays pure Lipgloss in the delegate — **no `lipgloss/tree`**.

### 14.2 Restyle existing render code (the bulk)
Edit current custom code and point it at palette tokens: the row delegates (`SessionDelegate` / `ProjectDelegate`), the manual three-column footer (→ condensed), the group `HeaderItem`, the kill / rename modals, the preview chrome (`pagepreview.go`), and the loading `viewLoading`.

### 14.3 New-but-small
- The **header / wordmark + separator block** above the list (≈ Lipgloss `JoinVertical`).
- **Edit-modal chips** (restyle the alias/tag field render into chip elements).

### 14.4 New-substantial (one)
The **`?` help modal** — a new modal type + binding `?` (currently swallowed) + a **generic renderer over the per-page keymap descriptor** (the single source of truth that drives footer + help; introduce the descriptor if one doesn't exist), not hand-authored content per page (~60–80 lines for the modal type + renderer). Extends the existing rounded-border modal overlay primitive.

### 14.5 Cross-cutting foundation
A **role-token colour layer** (the §2.9 tokens, each with light + dark variants), the **owned-canvas paint** (leaf `.Background(canvas)` + the outer full-terminal fill — §1), **explicit light/dark detection** (OSC 11 / `tea.RequestBackgroundColor`, the `appearance` pref, the detect-or-timeout first-paint gate — §2.6), contrast-floor adherence against the exact canvas, and `NO_COLOR` handling (suppress the canvas — §2.5). Moderate, touches every style — but it is **centralising colour + canvas, not adding widgets**. (Lipgloss v2 removed `AdaptiveColor`, so the light/dark choice is wired explicitly, not via a framework adaptive type.)

### 14.6 Open question — modal rendering path
Whether the existing modal render path can be **adapted** for the blank-screen treatment (§8.1) or needs a **modal-system rework** is **not yet determined** — assess against the code at implementation. The underlying confirm/input logic of each modal is preserved either way.

### 14.7 Separate engineering item
The **cold-path startup flip** (§10) — concurrent bootstrap + live progress — is plumbing, not a widget, and is its **own phase** (~1–1.5 days).

---

## 15. Design reference & visual verification

### 15.1 Paper design reference (the frame map)
All visual decisions are mocked in the Paper file **"Portal"** (`https://app.paper.design/file/01KVAT8NFHMBDTM4YY6V93R53S`, page "Page 1"), via the `paper` MCP. The **canonical frames** (build targets, uniform 860×680):

| Surface | Frame(s) | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| Sessions — flat | `Sessions — Modern Vivid v2` · `Sessions — Modern Vivid (Light)` | §4 |
| Sessions — grouped | `Sessions — by Project (MV)` · `Sessions — by Tag (MV)` | §5 |
| Filtering | `Filtering — input active (MV)` · `Filtering — list-active (MV)` · `Filtering — no matches (MV)` | §7 |
| Projects | `Projects (MV)` | §6 |
| Loading | `Loading 6 — Combined (thick bar)` | §10 |
| Help modal | `Sessions — Help Modal (?)` | §8 |
| Edit modal | `Edit Modal — navigate (name)` · `Edit Modal — chip focused` · `Edit Modal — edit in place` | §8 |
| Kill / Rename | `Kill Confirm Modal (MV)` · `Kill Confirm Modal (Light)` · `Rename Modal (MV)` | §8 |
| Preview | `Preview Screen (MV)` | §9 |
| Edge states | `Sessions — empty (MV)` · `Sessions — inline flash (MV)` · `Sessions — no tags signpost (MV)` · `Projects — command pending (MV)` | §11 |

All build-target frames are painted on the **owned canvas** (`#0b0c14` dark / `#e1e2e7` light).

Exploration frames (the five colour directions, loading concepts, MV v1) **and the `Sessions — MV on Nord bg` mid-tone preview** are reference-only — **not build targets**. Paper is an HTML approximation: authoritative for **layout, structure, and colour-role**, not pixel-exact rendering (the real terminal uses the user's font + the §2.9 token hexes).

### 15.2 `vhs` capture harness (the prescribed verification tool)
Visual verification uses **`vhs`** (charmbracelet/vhs) — a headless terminal driven by a `.tape` script that sends keys and writes a PNG. Prescribed for this feature (Portal is a Bubble Tea / charm app; `vhs` is the natural fit and runs in CI).

**Setup (one-time):**
1. `brew install vhs` — pulls its `ttyd` + `ffmpeg` dependencies. *(Non-Homebrew: `go install github.com/charmbracelet/vhs@latest`, with `ttyd` + `ffmpeg` installed separately.)*
2. Verify with `vhs --version`.

**Harness structure:**
- **One `.tape` per canonical screen**, committed under a fixed harness dir (e.g. `testdata/vhs/`).
- Each tape sets a fixed terminal size, seeds a **known fixture state** (a fixed set of sessions/projects for deterministic captures — fixture-seeding mechanics are a harness implementation detail), launches Portal, sends keys to reach the target screen, then `Screenshot <name>.png`. Example:
  ```
  Output sessions.png
  Set FontFamily "JetBrains Mono"
  Set Width 1280
  Set Height 800
  Type "portal"
  Enter
  Sleep 800ms
  Screenshot sessions.png
  ```
- Run `vhs <tape>` to produce the PNG.

**Pass criterion:** **layout / structure / colour-role match** to the named Paper frame — **agent/user-judged, NOT a pixel-diff CI gate** (Paper is an approximation; an exact diff would always fail). Tapes are committed and runnable so any reviewer can re-capture.

### 15.3 Per-task manual review
In addition to the `vhs` capture, the user inspects the rendered TUI in a real terminal at each task's end — catching font/colour realities the Paper approximation can't show.

### 15.4 Verification responsibilities in the task loop
Each implementation task runs a fixed loop with an explicit owner for the visual check at every step:

1. **Implementer (sub-agent)** — does the work **and produces the task's `vhs` capture**, comparing it to the named Paper frame to **self-verify before handing off**. The implementer owns the capture so it can check and converge its own work — without this, the implement↔review loop never terminates.
2. **Reviewer (sub-agent)** — reviews the **code** (its primary, essential job) **and** the **visual**: confirms the implementer's capture matches the frame (layout / structure / colour-role) and that **behaviour parity** holds (§1). Only when **both** pass does the task **gate for human review**.
3. **Human gate** — the human opens **both** the task's latest `vhs` capture **and** its committed Paper reference (§15.5), and inspects the live TUI, before approving.

**Screenshot storage (explicit):** each task's latest `vhs` PNG is **committed in-repo** under the harness dir, **named per frame/task** (e.g. `testdata/vhs/sessions-flat.png`), overwritten in place so "latest" is always current — giving the reviewer and the human a stable, well-labelled image to open without re-running anything.

### 15.5 Comparing the capture against the Paper reference
Each task's reference is its **named Paper frame** (§15.1). The comparison is made against a **committed PNG export of that frame** — exported from the Paper file via the **`paper` MCP** (`get_screenshot` / `export` by the frame's node-id) and committed alongside the tapes (e.g. `testdata/vhs/reference/<frame>.png`). This keeps the reference **in-repo and durable**: no live-MCP dependency at implementation or CI time, while the `paper` MCP is the *authoring source* that produces and refreshes these exports.

Both the **implementer** (self-check, §15.4) and the **reviewer** (gate, §15.4) place the task's **`vhs` capture beside the committed Paper reference** and judge **layout / structure / colour-role match**; the human gate opens both. When a frame changes in Paper, its reference export is **re-committed** so the baseline stays current.

### 15.6 Light-mode visual check (implementation task)
Light-mode coverage is **per-token, not per-screen** — verifying each light token once covers every screen that reuses it (the semantic-token payoff). The validated mocks (`Sessions — Modern Vivid (Light)`, `Kill Confirm Modal (Light)`) lock the direction and the full light **foreground** palette, so **no further Paper mocks are required**. Two residual checks are an explicit implementation task at the §15 gate:
- **Pin + eyeball each light surface tint** against `#e1e2e7` — `bg.selection` (`#D0C6F0`), `bg.warning`, `bg.track`, and the light borders (`#C9CDDB`) — not merely numerically. The recurring failure class is a **light tint on a light canvas**; a numeric pass is insufficient (§2.9).
- **Eyeball the remaining light modal/edit states** (rename, the three edit states, `?` help) and the **per-screen token wiring** in light mode against `#e1e2e7` — each rendered and visually confirmed, not just numerically verified.

---

## 16. Scope boundary

### 16.1 In scope (v1)
- The full **Modern Vivid reskin** across **every** surface — Sessions (flat / by-project / by-tag), Projects, Preview, Loading, all modals (edit two-mode, kill, rename, `?` help), filtering (two-mode), and every edge state (empty, inline flash, no-tags signpost, command-pending) — built **token-based** (theme-ready, §2.8).
- The **cold-path startup flip** (§10) — its own phase, gated behind in-terminal validation (§15).
- **The owned mode-matched canvas** (§1) — opaque `#0b0c14` (dark) / `#e1e2e7` (light), painted on every cell — with **explicit light/dark detection** (OSC 11) and the **`appearance: auto | light | dark` pref** in `prefs.json` (§2.6). `NO_COLOR` suppresses the canvas (§2.5).

### 16.2 Animation & performance
Animation is **minimal and idle-zero** — no idle CPU tick in an always-open tool. The loading screen animates only while bootstrap runs; the picker does not animate at rest.

### 16.3 Deferred (logged separately)
- **User-overridable theme system** — external theme file, merge-over-default, validation/clamp, multiple built-in themes, a `theme` setting, docs (§2.8), **and the "use terminal background" transparency opt-out** (respect-terminal + advisory-floor live here). Ships independently after the reskin. *(Logged: `.workflows/.inbox/ideas/2026-06-17--user-overridable-theme-system.md`.)*
- **Tag features (v2):** per-session tags (`@portal-tags` + `--tag=`), live-grouped filtering, tag exclusion (§5.5).

### 16.4 Cut
- The **animated cycling-colour border** — dropped for its idle-CPU cost in an always-open tool (inconsistent with idle-zero animation).

### 16.5 Lock-in gate
The colour direction is a **hypothesis until prototyped in a real terminal** (§15) — the in-terminal validation gate is the final lock before implementation closes; bail remains a legitimate outcome if the direction doesn't clear the bar (§1).
