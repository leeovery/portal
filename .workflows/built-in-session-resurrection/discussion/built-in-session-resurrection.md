# Discussion: Built-in Session Resurrection

## Context

Portal should own the full session lifecycle: server start → session restoration → resume hook execution. Currently the middle step depends on tmux-resurrect/continuum, which has a 100% failure rate — sessions never come back after reboot. The resume hook feature is effectively broken end-to-end despite the code being correct, because the session structure it depends on doesn't exist.

Research has confirmed full technical feasibility. tmux provides all the APIs needed for capture (`list-panes -a -F`) and restore (`new-session`, `split-window`, `select-layout`). The question is no longer *can we do this* but *how should we design it*.

Key design principles established in research:
- Portal's hook system is generic — no awareness of what consumers do with it
- Portal doesn't maintain a separate session registry — reads tmux directly
- Portal captures all sessions (Portal-created and native tmux), consistent with existing behavior
- Portal is always the entry point — bootstrap is the natural place for restoration
