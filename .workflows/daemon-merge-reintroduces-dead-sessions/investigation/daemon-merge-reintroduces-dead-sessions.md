# Investigation: Daemon Merge Reintroduces Dead Sessions

## Symptoms

### Problem Description

**Expected behavior:**
The daemon's structural index merge should not re-introduce sessions that have been killed in tmux. The `@portal-skeleton-<paneKey>` server-option marker is meant to preserve pre-hydrate state for panes that have been skeleton-restored but not yet hydrated — it must not override the live tmux session list.

**Actual behavior:**
`mergeSkippedPanes` → `mergePane` → `findOrAppendSession` (`internal/state/capture.go:154`) appends a session from `prev.Sessions` into the freshly-built index without checking whether that session still exists in tmux. Any paneKey in the marker set whose session has been killed in tmux causes the dead session to be re-committed to `sessions.json`. On the next bootstrap, the restore phase reconstructs the killed session from the saved state. To the user this presents as: "killed sessions reappear after Portal restart."

### Manifestation

- Killed session reappears in `~/.config/portal/state/sessions.json` within one daemon tick (≤30s) after deletion in tmux.
- Subsequent Portal bootstrap reconstructs the dead session via `internal/restore` from the polluted index.
- No error or warning surfaces — silent data corruption of the source of truth.

### Reproduction Steps

Synthetic repro (does not require triggering the hydrate cascade):

1. Inside a live tmux server, identify an existing pane and its paneKey.
2. Set the marker manually: `tmux set-option -s @portal-skeleton-<paneKey> 1`
3. `tmux kill-session -t <session>` against the session containing that pane.
4. Wait one daemon tick (≤30s).
5. Inspect `~/.config/portal/state/sessions.json` — the killed session is present.

**Reproducibility:** Always, given the marker set + session killed conditions.

**Live in-the-wild confirmation (2026-05-08):** the user observed three specific sessions resurrecting after kill: `agentic-workflows-XXrJ3J`, `leeovery-Gi5NLG`, `leeovery-feqhpg`. Inspecting `tmux show-options -s` revealed exactly three matching stale `@portal-skeleton-*` markers (`agentic-workflows-XXrJ3J__1.1`, `leeovery-Gi5NLG__1.1`, `leeovery-feqhpg__1.1`). Killing an unmarkered session (`game-ideas`) did NOT resurrect it. This is the cleanest possible empirical confirmation: presence of marker is necessary AND sufficient (given a daemon tick) for the resurrection symptom.

### Environment

- **Affected environments:** Local — any installation running `portal state daemon`.
- **User conditions:** Any user running Portal with the resurrection feature enabled (i.e. all current users).

### Impact

- **Severity:** High — silent corruption of the persisted state; user-visible "zombie" sessions; eroded trust that `kill-session` is permanent.
- **Scope:** All users; triggers under any path that produces a stale `@portal-skeleton-*` marker (hydrate timeout, daemon crash mid-hydrate, version-upgrade restart, manual tmux ops).
- **Business impact:** Trust regression on a core product promise (user controls their session list).

## Analysis

### Initial Hypotheses

The merge step in `CaptureStructure` trusts the `@portal-skeleton-<paneKey>` marker set as authoritative evidence that a session is "in flight" (skeleton-created, awaiting hydrate). It does not cross-check the live tmux session list — which it has just enumerated in the same call — so a stale marker pulls a dead session forward indefinitely.

### Code Trace

**Entry point:** `tick` in `cmd/state_daemon.go:77` — fires every 1s in the `_portal-saver` daemon.

**Execution path:**

1. `cmd/state_daemon.go:115` `captureAndCommit` reads the marker set:
   `skipSet, err := state.ListSkeletonMarkers(deps.Client)` — this is the full set of `@portal-skeleton-<paneKey>` server options regardless of whether the underlying session still exists.
2. `cmd/state_daemon.go:121` calls `state.CaptureStructure(deps.Client, skipSet, deps.PrevIndex)`.
3. `internal/state/capture.go:62-106` `CaptureStructure`:
   - Line 66: `ListSessionNames` → live tmux session names.
   - Line 71: `keepSessionNames` strips internal-prefix → set of live, non-internal session names. **This is the live-session truth.**
   - Lines 85-96: builds the fresh `[]Session` from `keep`. **Killed sessions are correctly absent here.**
   - Line 100: `if len(skipSet) > 0 && prev != nil { mergeSkippedPanes(&idx, *prev, skipSet) }` — **the bug surface.**
4. `internal/state/capture.go:117-130` `mergeSkippedPanes` iterates `prev.Sessions` and for each pane whose `SanitizePaneKey` is in `skipSet`, calls `mergePane`. **No reference to `keep` or `idx.Sessions` for live-session validation.**
5. `internal/state/capture.go:137-148` `mergePane` → `findOrAppendSession` (line 154) — this is where the dead session is re-created in `idx.Sessions` if not present.
6. After `CaptureStructure` returns, `captureAndCommit` writes the polluted index to `sessions.json` via `state.Commit` (line 152) and updates `deps.PrevIndex = &idx` (line 156). **The dead session is now part of `prev` for every subsequent tick — bug self-sustains.**
7. Next bootstrap (`cmd/bootstrap` step 5, Restore) reads `sessions.json` and reconstructs the dead session.

**Key files involved:**
- `internal/state/capture.go` — `mergeSkippedPanes`, `mergePane`, `findOrAppendSession`. The defective layer.
- `cmd/state_daemon.go` — `captureAndCommit`, `tick`. Caller; updates `PrevIndex` to the committed (polluted) index every tick.
- `internal/state/markers.go` — `ListSkeletonMarkers`. Faithfully reads markers; not at fault.
- `internal/state/capture_test.go:570-617` — the test `merges a skipped pane's session and window from prev when missing from fresh` **codifies the current (buggy) behaviour** and will need updating as part of the fix.

**Marker lifecycle (how stale markers arise):**
- **Set** by `internal/restore/session.go:380-384` (`setSkeletonMarker` → `state.SetSkeletonMarker`) during bootstrap step 5 skeleton restore.
- **Unset** by hydrate helper at `cmd/state_hydrate.go:312` (`UnsetSkeletonMarkerForFIFO`) after scrollback replay completes.
- **Leak paths** (any of these produces a stale marker whose session may later be killed):
  1. Hydrate timeout — pane never gets hydrated; marker survives.
  2. Daemon crash mid-hydrate — never reaches the unset.
  3. User runs `tmux kill-session` against a not-yet-hydrated pane — pane goes away, marker stays.
  4. Version-upgrade of `_portal-saver` mid-hydrate.
  5. Manual `tmux set-option -s @portal-skeleton-<key>` (synthetic repro).
- **No cleanup path exists.** The bootstrap orchestrator's step 8 `CleanStale` only prunes hook-store entries (`cmd/bootstrap_production.go:63`), not markers. `SweepOrphanFIFOs` in step 7 only removes orphan FIFO files. Once a marker leaks, it persists for the tmux server's lifetime.

### Root Cause

`mergeSkippedPanes` (`internal/state/capture.go:117`) treats the `@portal-skeleton-<paneKey>` marker set as authoritative evidence that the session is "in flight." It does not validate against the live tmux session list — which is already known inside the same `CaptureStructure` call as `keep` / `idx.Sessions`. A stale marker therefore causes `findOrAppendSession` (line 154) to append a dead session into the freshly-built index, which then gets committed to `sessions.json` and persists into `prev` indefinitely (self-reinforcing through `captureAndCommit`'s `deps.PrevIndex = &idx` at line 156).

**Why this happens:** The merge logic was designed under the implicit assumption that markers cannot be stale. It correctly handles the *intended* case (pane skeleton-created, awaiting hydrate, briefly invisible to tmux) but does not defend against the *unintended* case (marker outlives its underlying session via any of the leak paths above).

### Contributing Factors

- Marker is server-scoped (`set-option -s`), persisting across hydrate failures, daemon restarts, manual tmux ops, and indefinitely if hydrate never runs.
- `prev` in `captureAndCommit` is replaced with the just-committed index every successful tick (`cmd/state_daemon.go:156`), so once a dead session is committed once, it lives in `prev` indefinitely — the bug is self-sustaining even if the marker were later cleared.
- No marker cleanup path in bootstrap. `SweepOrphanFIFOs` cleans orphan FIFOs but not the markers that point at them; `CleanStale` cleans hook entries but not markers.
- The merge currently has no live-session cross-check — `keep` (the live-tmux truth, computed at line 71 of `CaptureStructure`) is not threaded into `mergeSkippedPanes`.

### Why It Wasn't Caught

- The existing unit test (`capture_test.go:570-617`) explicitly asserts the buggy behaviour as correct ("merges a skipped pane's session and window from prev when missing from fresh") — this codifies the wrong invariant.
- The original spec for the resurrection feature (`built-in-session-resurrection`) framed merge intent around the hydrate-in-progress scenario without modelling marker-staleness adversarial cases.
- The `built-in-session-resurrection` feature integration tests exercise the happy-path skeleton → hydrate flow, not the killed-mid-flight path.
- Reproducing in the wild requires either a hydrate failure (hard to engineer in CI) or a manual marker injection, so the bug was unlikely to surface during normal QA.

### Blast Radius

**Directly affected:**
- `internal/state` — committed `sessions.json` becomes inconsistent with live tmux.
- `internal/restore` — reconstructs ghost sessions on bootstrap.

**Potentially affected:**
- Any consumer that reads `sessions.json` (CLI list commands, TUI session picker after a restart) sees the ghost session.

## Notes

This bug is independently wrong from the companion hydrate-cascade bug. Even with a perfect FIFO IPC, markers can become stale via process crashes, version-upgrade restart, or manual tmux operations. The merge logic should not assume marker validity on the user's behalf.
