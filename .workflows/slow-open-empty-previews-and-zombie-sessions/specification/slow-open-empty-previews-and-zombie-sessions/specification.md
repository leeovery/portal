# Specification: Slow Open Empty Previews And Zombie Sessions

## Specification

## Problem Statement

This bugfix addresses three user-visible symptoms produced by a single underlying defect: Portal's daemon-singleton invariant is not enforced end-to-end. The same broken-singleton state surfaces as three different downstream effects.

**Symptoms:**

1. **Slow `portal open` (5–8 s)** — Every invocation pays a 5 s timeout before the TUI renders. Caused by the bootstrap kill-barrier in `killSaverAndWaitForDaemon` polling for the recorded `daemon.pid` to exit after `tmux kill-session _portal-saver`; when the recorded daemon is not the saver pane's process, the kill is structurally unreachable and the barrier always times out at its 5 s limit. `portal open` is expected to be sub-second.

2. **Empty session previews** — Pressing `Space` on any session in the picker shows "no saved content" even though the scrollback exists inside tmux. Caused by competing daemons each running `gcOrphanScrollback` against the same state directory with divergent indexes — the scrollback directory oscillates between 0 and 1 `.bin` file as each daemon's commit deletes files referenced only by the other's view. Expected: the highlighted session's captured scrollback renders in the preview pane.

3. **Killed sessions resurrect** — Sessions removed via `K` in the picker (or via the user's `Option-Q` tmux shortcut) reappear on the next `portal open` and persist indefinitely. Caused by multiple daemons independently committing `sessions.json` every tick — the legitimate daemon's post-kill commit (without the dead session) is overwritten seconds later by a competing daemon whose stale `prev` state still includes it. Restore on next bootstrap reconstructs the dead session as a skeleton pane. Expected: `K` removes the session permanently.

## Scope

Bundle all seven fix components (A–G, defined below) into a single bugfix work unit. Each independently closes a real defect or latent fragility; the user has explicitly chosen defence-in-depth over a minimum-viable patch. The framing is "fix Portal so this type of thing never happens" — A+B+G handle the consequences and the known triggers, C closes the underlying *mechanism* (the inode-replacement gap that lets divergent daemons coexist) so unforeseen future triggers cannot recreate the same bug class, and D bounds orphan lifetime to one tick *between* bootstraps so the daemon is polite about its own existence even when no `portal` invocation runs.

## Out of Scope

- **Re-architecting the saver/daemon ownership model.** The current "saver pane process IS the daemon" model is retained; this bugfix hardens the surrounding invariants rather than replacing them.
- **Replacing `flock` with an alternative locking primitive.** Component C tightens the existing `flock`+inode contract rather than swapping primitives. The "flock `sessions.json` itself" alternative was ruled out during investigation synthesis because `fileutil.AtomicWrite0600` replaces sessions.json's inode on every Commit, which would itself break flock semantics.
- **Migrating away from per-tick `sessions.json` rewrites.** The commit + GC pipeline shape is unchanged; only per-session error tolerance and cross-daemon coexistence are hardened.
